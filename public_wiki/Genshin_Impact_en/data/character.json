With a strong sense of justice, Yanfei does not mind traveling to help her clients should they have trouble in different parts of . She claims to have extensive knowledge of the laws of the other nations in  — though, she notes 's law to be the most difficult. She is well known by the people of Liyue for her knowledge and is considered the premier legal advisor of Liyue, a title that garners her many a client across the nation. Even , the Tianquan of the , states that Yanfei's memorization of the law allows her to quickly close loopholes in existing laws faster than she would have been able to herself. When resolving disputes, Yanfei always gets all legal evidence beforehand to make a compelling and convincing argument. Although she can handle any case, she dislikes having to deal with civil suits. As many in Liyue do, Yanfei places a high value on the importance of contracts, though she is noted to place a higher value on them more than the average person due to the nature of her job.\n\nDespite having the blood of an  in her veins, Yanfei is not particularly concerned about her adeptal heritage and is one of the few who did not sign a contract with  due to being born in an era of peace. It is not through any adepti powers or abilities that she may have that she endeavors to make life in Liyue better, but through her profession. She is very active and often talks a lot, a stark contrast to her adeptus father, whom  states to be more solemn. She spends her time much like an average human does, and unlike most adepti, Yanfei doesn't consider herself above mortals in any way.\n\nDespite her playful nature, Yanfei takes her job seriously and practically, ensuring she and all involved parties of a case are well accounted for. She is also willing to do pro bono work as long as she isn't required to be deeply involved. Yanfei dreams of a day where people live honest and happy lives, and there is no longer a need for legal advisors. Should such a day ever come, Yanfei's backup plan is to become a rapper.\n\nYanfei enjoys tofu because of its versatility and availability. She dislikes cold food and she rarely eats them since her father told her that food was best served hot."

Some people say I'm pretty terrifying, others try to avoid me altogether, but I don't need to explain myself to anyone. Since the very beginning, the welfare of Liyue has been my primary concern! Think about it — the origin of disputes can be traced back to the violation of contracts. People are a lot less likely to violate contracts when they see the fallout.

I've also got quite a way with words — nobody can beat me in a debate. And yet, there is no law or standard that can define a happy life. For me... interesting people and engaging affairs, knowing where to go and which path to choose... these are all enough to bring me happiness. And on that note, you too are a source of happiness for me. In any case, whatever the life you live, the most important thing is to respect and understand the law.

They say it's to exchange angling tips, but deep down everyone's keen to show off. I've gotten the better of everyone a hundred different ways, but they continue to scrutinize my business...

                "More About Keqing: I": "You want to know more about me? Sure. Let's start with the principles that are central to the role of Yuheng. Once you've memorized the hundred or more contractual obligations of the position, you'll know my hopes and dreams like the back of your hand!",
                "More About Keqing: II": "Nothing exists independently, and there's nothing you can do to change that. So, when you drag your heels on one thing, you're actually causing chaos for a whole bunch of other connected issues, too. That's why I firmly believe you should never put off until tomorrow what you can do today. ...I'm also a very impatient person and can't stand procrastinating, so that's also part of it.",
                "More About Keqing: III": "Never mince your words with me, okay? Yuheng's just a title. I'll not have you treading on eggshells around me just because of my status. Say what's on your mind, always — that's what makes you unique, and it's the thing I admire about you the most.",

He isn't fond of most social interactions and thus rarely travels to the city of Mondstadt unless it is to meet up with his fellow alchemists or other acquaintances. Yet he's also shown to at least be fascinated or interested in them in some way, often willingly appearing in events that have some sort of social setting going on and helping out the people around him in any way he can. While he does seem to enjoy company and seeing how people interact in a social setting, he finds relationships stressful and tiresome because of the amount of effort needed to maintain them. This doesn't mean he dislikes the relationships he has with others, he simply struggles with them and can get tired out from trying to keep track of everything to keep the relationship from falling apart. He prefers being around children, especially , seeing her as a younger sister. Klee in turn sees him as an older brother figure.\n\nFueled by the feeling of enlightenment, he researches about the things that pique his interest, and once the feeling is gone, either by uncovering its truth or otherwise, he loses all interest, left with a bittersweet sensation in his mind. Along with his alchemical genius, Albedo is also a respectable artist. Having initially learned the talent as a way to help with his experiments, it is now a form of relaxation for him. He is 's illustrator and regards him as a good author.\n\nAs much of a positive demeanor he gives off, the people of  do not know anything about his personal life and he is particularly secretive about it towards them. To the Traveler, he does not mind sharing most of his secrets with them due to feeling a kinship of sorts as they are both not of , him being an artificial lifeform and the Traveler a visitor from afar.

            "quote": "Meet Tartaglia — the cunning Snezhnayan whose unpredictable personality keeps people guessing his every move. Don't be under any illusion as to what he might be thinking or what his intentions are. Just remember this: Behind that innocent, childlike exterior lies a finely honed instrument of war.",
            "Personality": "No. 11 of The Harbingers, also known as \"Childe.\" His name is highly feared on the battlefield.\n\nTartaglia describes himself as \"kind of a bad guy\", living for the thrill of a fight and causing chaos. As a child, Tartaglia was frightened and hesitant, but he secretly desired to become an adventurer like the ones his father told him about as they fished together. After falling into The Abyss and meeting and training with , Tartaglia's personality drastically changed. Although he appears to relatively friendly on the surface, Tartaglia is a bloodthirsty warrior. The Abyss and his old master, Skirk, made him self-confident, solipsistic, and brash, thriving on the sensation of being alive. A warrior at heart, he constantly seeks ways to grow stronger, regardless of how he obtains said power. Tartaglia considers those who wish to become strong like him to be friends and takes pleasure in battling them on the battlefield. He lusts for combat and grows excited by fighting strong opponents, even if it could mean dying in the process. He uses bows because he is weakest with them, making his victories with them all the more exhilarating.\n\nBecause of his pride, Tartaglia is exceptionally reliable at accomplishing the tasks given to him, no matter how difficult they may be or if they go against his values. This, combined with his straightforward nature, makes him rather easy to manipulate. Despite disliking how his plan in Liyue Harbor could potentially harm innocents, he puts it into motion to fulfill his mission in Liyue — only to learn he was meant to fail as part of an even larger plan he was not privy to, much to his consternation.\n\nAmongst the rest of the Harbingers, Tartaglia is considered an oddball. While his fellow Harbingers prefer clandestine operations and staying behind the scenes, Tartaglia favors being front and center. He is a public figure known for attending social gatherings and even participates as an actor in plays and theater. As a result, Childe's coworkers are wary of him, while he holds them in disdain for their schemes and \"intangible\" methods. While he is easily capable of scheming, he only resorts to such approaches when necessary due to his straightforward nature. He also appears to treat his subordinates less harshly than the rest of the Harbingers, stating that he doesn't use lethal force against the recruits in his care nor does he threaten any of them.\n\nTartaglia dedicates himself to those he cares about wholeheartedly. He is unquestionably loyal to the Tsaritsa and holds her in high esteem, seeing himself as her weapon of war.YouTube: [https://youtu.be/RfTgT81cVxE Collected Miscellany - \"Childe: Foul Legacy\"] He also cares deeply for his family; he sends money, gifts, and letters home often. Tartaglia is exceptionally proud of his three younger siblings and dotes on them frequently, especially his youngest brother Teucer — he is willing to lie and even put himself in mortal danger, so as long as it makes him happy. Although he was once on good terms with Zhongli (even allowing the former Archon to use him as financial support), he seems to have taken his deception personally, stating he will only forgive him if he agrees to trial by combat. Zhongli appears to be unaware of Tartaglia's change in opinion, being under the impression he will still meet him for drinks to catch up after the recent Liyue events."

                "When It Snows": "Snow this big only falls a few times a year. If I miss it, I'll have to wait until next year to run my experiments, so please give me some space. Ah-Ahchooo! ...Yes, I know, I should wear more layers...",
                "When the Sun Is Out": "Th-The sun is already out? Oh, ah, okay! Just one last experiment, and then we can get some rest. Last one, I promise...",
                "When It Rains": "Humidity levels are increasing. Think we could run some tests?",
                "Good Morning": "Good morning. Did you sleep well? According to research, not getting a good night's sleep can have detrimental effects on your cognition and stamina. What? I'm always up working through the night? Yeah, I know... Can't be helped I guess...",
                "Good Afternoon": "Waaaaa! No, stay back, don't come over here! No, no, it's nothing personal — it's just that this experiment is highly volatile and might cause an explosion.",

                "Good Night": "No need to wait up for me. Please, get some sleep. Something bothering you? Oh, don't worry about me — I'm right at the end of my experiment. I promise I won't stay up late again...",
                "About Sucrose: Bio-Alchemy": "Bio-alchemy, when compared with creation, places more emphasis on transformation. Finding those little secrets that living creatures have and scaling them up, combining them — the results are always such a surprise. Life really is fascinating. Just how much do we really know?",
                "About Sucrose: Fear of Strangers": "I... um... really don't know how to act around new people. Everyone's personality is different, as are the things they care about. If I slip up and say the wrong thing, I'll offend someone, or sound impolite... Talking is hard, so much harder than alchemy.",

                "About Us: Perks": "To be honest, I was a little afraid when we first met, because you don't talk much... I thought I must have offended you somehow. But then as time went on, I discovered you're really easy to get along with. Hehe, just an unexpected outcome of my observations.",
                "About Us: Requests": "I heard it was you that dealt with the  issue. No doubt it was a dangerous fight — it's a good thing you came out unscathed. I was ahh... also wondering — did Stormterror happen to drop anything during the fight? You know, a scale, some skin — even just a little would be fine. There are some tests I'd like to run...",
                "About the": "My Vision is my most important research tool. Hmm? Why, without it I'd be unable to proceed with most of my elemental research. Combat? Oh, I suppose I use it for that too when I'm out in the field looking for materials.",
                "Something to Share": "This room is where I keep all the bones I've collected. On the table on the left we have lizards, frogs, and grass carp.

Oh, this one is project 3, version 17, enlargement trial. Its defining trait is that... it's a bit larger.",
                "About": "The role of a scout is a hazardous one, and Ms. Eula throws herself into danger all too easily. So, I made a reconnaissance device for her, so that she wouldn't have to infiltrate enemy camps herself. But Ms. Eula has such an imposing manner, she really puts me on edge, and... I was so nervous that I accidentally left out a few important details while explaining how to use it... As a result, there was an accident... Ah, what should I do... I hope she won't hold a grudge against me...",
                "About : Artistry": "As his assistant I learn so much each and every day. What's key is not his existing knowledge, but his talented way of thinking. No matter how complex the task at hand, his way of thinking ensures he gets to the bottom of it, and is able to explain it thoroughly. His methodologies are amazing... to me, it's where alchemy meets art.",
                "About : Talent": "Talent? Let's hypothesize that he and I were to perform the same research — I'd still spend my whole life playing catch up. But, my studying bio-alchemy has nothing to do with evading his line of research, we just happen to have different interests and dreams — nothing more.",

                "More About Sucrose: III": "When I was little, I had two good friends — we kept nothing from each other. I thought I knew everything about them, but then... stuff happened, and we grew distant. As for where they are now, what they're doing, whether or not they remember me... I have no idea. Even though we were best friends, things still turned out this way.",
                "More About Sucrose: IV": "Let me tell you a little secret, something I've never told anyone. The purpose behind my research is to create my own wonderland. Yes... just like the ones in fairy tales. The kind where all your dreams come true and you live happily ever after. Hehe, it's childish, isn't it? But, I still believe in fairy tales.",
                "More About Sucrose: V": "If you're busy, please don't let me stand in the way of progress. ...You're not busy? Really? It's fine, I—I get that you have stuff to do. I'm already quite used to working alone. ...You're truly not busy? I—In that case, I don't suppose you could help me with a few things? Or, you know, we could sit and chat about... stuff.",

All my potions are lined up according to effect and hue— Wha—What!? What is this purple potion doing here!? Sorry, I—I need to reassess the order of these potions!",
                "Sucrose's Troubles": "I wonder... What is it that you do in your free time? Every time I get a break, I can never find anything to do. I just find myself staring off into space. Time goes by so quickly when I'm experimenting, so how is it that when I'm not doing anything, the days all feel like years...",

One might find Chongyun as a composed and stoic individual, though his friends might not say it is true most of the time.\n\nChongyun is a positive individual quite literally, as he has an excess of positive energy in him. Due to this excess in positive energy, he's vulnerable to things that warms him — fiery events, food, drinks, clothing, the sun, and even blushing. In the event he is not able to suppress those feelings, he might enter a manic state of being excited, friendly or faint. In extreme cases, he may show extreme signs of irrationality. To counter said positive energy, he always wears light-colored and light-weight clothing and usually eats cold food, though even with these methods and despite his efforts, he still has issues overcoming his unusual constitution.\n\nDespite having a , he's not as fond of it as others, believing that training is the way to become a stronger individual. Due to his intense training and the sole focus of exorcising a demon, Chongyun is extremely introverted in everything outside of exorcism. He regards  as a friend due to their similar agendas despite being pranked on by the bookworm on a frequent basis, which he usually tolerates. Even beyond Xingqiu's pranks, Chongyun can be quite gullible, such as once taking the contents of a novel to be real-life events until informed otherwise."

After his father's untimely demise as a result of using a , along with Inspector  ordering Diluc to cover up the incident, his faith in the Knights shattered and he left the organization. Even after Eroch was purged from the Knights for being a traitor, he still holds resentment towards them. He claims that the Knights take too long to get the job done, although he still appreciates those who put the effort in, such as  and .\n\nWhen he was a member of the Knights, he adored his father, . Being praised by his father made him happier than fame and anything else, and Crepus told Diluc to be faithful in his duties. After his father's death, he has been suppressing himself. Despite coming off as bitter and grumpy through his speech, he has a gentle, tender, and modest nature. In his childhood, Diluc had a lighthearted and happy nature, rather to the contrary of him now.\n\nDiluc is not fond of alcohol, as he does not like its taste and that it clouds his mind when he tries to work. He prefers non-alcoholic drinks such as grape juice and apple cider, which he had ordered developed upon his return to Mondstadt. This does not appear to be well known by many however, most likely as a result of him being the current owner of Mondstadt's largest wine producer. He even expresses surprise when he learns that  also loathes alcohol, having initially believed that he was the only bartender in Mondstadt that did not like alcohol. He also tends to part with his possessions he no longer needs, such as his father's private residence."

Through her unique abilities, eccentric character, and (while she would never admit it herself) hard work, Fischl has become a rising star among the Adventurers' Guild's investigators, earning the recognition of all.",
            "Personality": "A mysterious girl who calls herself \"Prinzessin der Verurteilung\" and travels with a night raven named Oz.\nDue to her upbringing as a child, Fischl is obsessed with fantasy stories and roleplays as a benevolent princess. She speaks in a polite and formal manner to all, which greatly confuses those who interact with her. For this purpose, Oz ends up translating most of her speech if they are confused. She is so used to speaking this way that breaking character ends up confusing the people she talks to just as much as staying in character. Fischl has a knack for investigating in part due to her own theories and Oz, which has allowed her to quickly climb up the ranks of the Adventurers' Guild. Even when her ideas sound outlandish, such as claiming a meteor shower to be the result of a curse, Oz is quick to ask others not to underestimate her intuition, as her instincts are very keen.\n\nOutside of guild duties, many people view her strangely due to her her antics and roleplay, while this sometimes bothers her, she continues roleplaying regardless because it's her passion. She has very few friends and appreciates those who are willing to go along with her despite her eccentricities.\n\nOutside of roleplaying, she is a kind and well-behaved yet bashful girl. She gets along well with her parents, even if she doesn't spend much time with them or they disagree with some of her decisions. Lisa, who generally gets in a bad mood when people neglect the books they borrow from the library, states that Fischl always keeps the books she borrows in good condition and returns them early. She cares about her friends and peers, even if not particularly close, showing concern about the well-being of her \"retinue\" (Fellow Adventurers' Guild members). When she unintentionally breaks character or reveals something about herself, she often gets flustered. She tends not to dwell too much on the past, trying to see herself as Fischl, not as her true identity, who she considers a different person, as thinking of her past brings her sadness. Deep down, she can also be quite self-deprecating and insecure, having a hard time taking setbacks well, this can cause her to cling to the escapism and comfort of her persona."

            "Personality": "An accomplished swordsman and a strategic thinker in the Knights of Favonius, rumored to hail from beyond Mondstadt.\nKaeya is an outwardly confident and charming individual with a flair for drama. He is sometimes seen as overly laid-back and even lazy, but he takes his work seriously. He is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of \"top candidate for grandson-in-law.\" His charisma and determination have earned him the admiration, respect, and favor of many people in Mondstadt — yet, his love for provoking others has also gained him the exasperation of those same people. Kaeya also enjoys putting people into high-stress situations and challenging their values, which he does to both his enemies and his allies alike. He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes at the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.\n\nHe seems to get a kick out of telling bold-faced lies and convincing others to do his work, but this serves him well in his role in the Knights of Favonius. He is a self-proclaimed \"anti-hero with an attitude problem;\" as long as everything ends the way he wants, Kaeya does not care about the methods used. Still, according to his informant , he draws the line at working with those who threaten other people's families, believing they deserve to be \"hunted down and destroyed.\"\n\nDespite his extroversion, the Traveler has observed that he appears to struggle with loneliness, though he playfully deflects when confronted about it. He frequently reminds the Traveler that they can talk to him, invites them to spend time with him, insistently offers (sometimes extensive) assistance, and often voices his disappointment whenever the Traveler has to leave, showing his desire to be helpful and aversion to being alone."

Erudite, but prideful.\n\nMona is an astrologist who takes her passion seriously. She is very knowledgeable in this subject in part and respects, yet also fears , her master, at the same time. She combines her astrology skills with hydromancy, which makes her a well-known, if still growing astrologist. In part due to her astrology, Mona can tell whether or not a person is lying, can sense their intentions from a single glance, being capable of seeing their fate and is able to accurately deduce a person's traits just from knowing what their constellation is.\n\nBeing obsessed with astrology gives Mona a sense of pride, but this also serves as a double-edged sword; any  she gets her hands on is immediately spent on astrology-related materials, regardless of its cost. She only realizes too late when she has run out of Mora to meet her daily needs, occasionally going without shelter or food for days on end. She is particularly picky when it comes to eating, as she prefers simple dishes when eating out; when she cooks, she makes the most out of whatever she can buy. She does not tolerate those who disrespect her. She also makes a lot of denials when someone is pointing out what she doesn't have."

But on her worst days, she even forgets to look at her notebook...",
            "Personality": "An apprentice and herb gatherer at . An undead with a bone-white complexion, she seldom has much in the way of words or emotion.\nQiqi has a quiet yet polite demeanor when dealing with customers at the pharmacy. As a , Qiqi has trouble retaining memories and can quickly forget about people if she doesn't continually reinforce herself with an impression of them, using her Vision to protect those she holds dear. Due to her undead nature, Qiqi has a relatively dull tone of voice and cannot convey most of her emotions to others, nor does she have a sense of smell. Despite her stoicness, she retains a sense of childlike naivety, as she believed coconut milk to have come from an animal, even dubbing said fictional creature the \"cocogoat\". She prefers cold weather, as the heat reminds her of death, and her flesh begins to decay if she stays too long in such places.\n\nAlthough zombies have to be issued orders when awoken, because Qiqi had done so herself, she is a rare case. She has to give herself orders to perform her duties. These duties cannot be canceled, and she must either finish the task or be forced to cancel it by hugging her with enough sincerity. She takes her responsibilities seriously, carrying a notebook in which she details everything she needs to do for the day, which also serves as a reminder in case she forgets something. She also strives to improve herself, so she becomes less forgetful. However, some days, she may forget to check on her notebook.\n\nWhile she generally gets along with everyone, she loses it whenever  comes or is mentioned, remarking that she has a \"punchable face\" and despises her, expressing an intent to throw the director into the fridge due to her insistence on sealing her away. This has happened so often that Qiqi began to remember and fear Hu Tao, even memorizing hiding places to avoid her. Even after giving her an exception and pampering her, Qiqi still holds a grudge against Hu Tao. Although Qiqi works for Baizhu, she can never remember his face, which she does not mind since she is aware that he has ulterior motives toward her."

Razor is also a quick thinker, as he is able to fix 's disasters whenever she goes to play in Wolvendom.\n\nRazor is honest and forthright, due to his limited exposure to human life.

In the game, he responds to Paimon's comments and nicknaming by parroting her.\n\nVenti enjoys roaming around Mondstadt playing songs to his people, most of whom are unaware of his true identity as Barbatos. He is very well-liked due to his musical talent, having won the title \"Most Popular Bard of Mondstadt\" three times. He is also an avid drinker of alcoholic beverages, such as  and has an unusually high tolerance to alcohol. He is also fine with apple cider.

For reasons unknown, he is deathly allergic to cats and will not perform unless he is certain none are nearby.\n\nHe also enjoys apples, considering them to be the fruit of the gods, jokingly stating that he would refuse to go to  even if he was invited because their apples are bland and the water foul, which would make bad cider.

            "Personality": "An explosives expert and a regular at the Knights of Favonius's confinement room. Also known as Fleeing Sunlight.\nKlee is an energetic and outgoing girl who takes after her mother, Alice. She has a particular talent for creating explosives and is not fazed by the sound of explosions. She adores anything that can blow up like her bombs, such as 's . She acts like a typical energetic young child who loves playing with her friends. Unfortunately, her definition of playing usually involves explosives; she is particularly fond of \"fish blasting\", tossing bombs into lakes full of fish.\n\nIn part due to her young age, Klee can be very naïve at times and easily confused by topics she doesn't have any context for, such as mistaking Mondstadt's wine industry for a monster, and wondering why  is always grumpy, even going as far as to call him the \"weird grown-up\". Klee is not fond of seeing people argue, as she believes that they only come when someone was in the wrong and that it doesn't feel right to her.\n\nWhile she's considered an official member of the Knights of Favonius, Klee's antics often get her into trouble. Like any child, she often tries to flee to avoid being reprimanded, but is eventually caught by  who sends her to solitary confinement to self-reflect. While she occasionally does try to do so, she almost always quickly forgets and instead uses the time to brainstorm new bombs and explosives.\n\nKlee loves her fellow knights, and is well-loved by them in turn. She is particularly fond of  and . Whenever she heads out of the city to play, she always follows the \"survival rules\" which Kaeya gave her. Albedo, on the other hand, is an older brother figure who takes care of her. She is also quite fond of Diona, even catching fish to share and offering her Dodoco to pet when Klee unintentionally upsets her. She loves her parents, though she does not see them frequently as they often travel around Teyvat and thus have little time to spend with her."

She despises just about anyone who indulges in alcohol, apart from  and .\n\nAlthough Diona has the option of literally destroying the industry, she chose not to, instead opting to do so by plummeting the industry's reputation by becoming a bartender and serving terrible drinks. Unfortunately for her, her long-forgotten childhood friend, the , blessed her with a magic touch that makes all of her drinks delicious, regardless of how noxious the ingredients used are, and she herself is unaware of this.\n\nIn her voiceovers, Diona proves to be a classic  and is very naïve. She worries over the Traveler's ability to get home safely without night vision and offers to escort them home until they remind her that street lamps exist, after which she quickly denies ever having offered escorting them. She blames  for her father's problems, even though the Dawn Winery had existed well before him or , and fails to see why the fans she and  gets are drastically different.

She genuinely enjoys the company of those who have earned her trust, such as Klee and the Traveler, finding comfort in the Traveler's touch even begs them not to leave her and \"become another dream\". Although she displays many cat-like mannerisms, such as her love for fish, naps, hatred of vegetables and water, and tendency to meow, purr, and bite when angry, she hates being referred to as a cat in this regard.

She also completes whatever is given to her, whether it be tasks or food, even if she is reluctant to do so. Privately, she tends to snap whenever people speak ill of  or the Geo Archon. She greatly respects her fellow adepti, especially  and , seeing them as a mentor and a maternal figure respectively, although she becomes extremely anxious in the latter's presence due to her tendency to unintentionally ramble.\n\nGanyu has served as the non-stopping secretary of the Liyue Qixing for thousands of years. The more important the task is, the more effort she puts into it, but she also becomes increasingly nervous and is more prone to making mistakes.\n\nShe has a huge work schedule, often working overtime and is prone to falling asleep. As a result, Ganyu has very few friends outside of work. Due to her age, she is very forgetful, and she often forgets important details which causes her much embarrassment. She is very sensitive about her horns, weight and childhood, becoming visibly flustered when any of these three are mentioned in front of her."

He never made a peep, but he completed all of his tasks quite admirably. He even volunteered to run errands for me, and assist with communication... Hmph... I don't know who is going around telling people that I need looking after...",
                "About : Returning": "Mika's personality hasn't changed one bit since he's been out with the expedition, though his abilities have improved significantly. The Grand Master is clearly making sure nobody neglects their training... Hmm? Mika's unaware of his own improvement? It must be one of his blind spots... or perhaps he's just being humble. Either way, things like this don't escape me. I know my team.",
                "More About Eula: I": "The life of a Lawrence doesn't include much worth talking about... Basically, whatever you say, whatever you do, people will always despise you and treat you like a potential threat to society. It's nowhere near as bad as it used to be, though. Before I'd joined the Knights, good grief... I couldn't even buy groceries. Even Good Hunter and Mondstadt General Goods wouldn't take my money. I literally had to go out and hunt my own food and cook it over a campfire if I wanted to eat dinner.",
                "More About Eula: II": "People tell me that if I just spoke more softly, or was more polite, or acted more deferentially, others may find it easier to forgive me, but the only reason they think that way is because they've never been branded a pariah before. There is no easy path to redemption when you're a social pariah. I'm more inclined to stop tiptoeing around everyone all the time and just get out there and make them respect me the old-fashioned way! As in, we square off and if they win, I humbly accept my punishment, but if they lose, they must acquiesce to my demands... Such as... Well, I mean, if I want to buy a loaf of bread, take my darn money, for crying out loud!",
                "More About Eula: III": "The Knights of Favonius are actually fairly reasonable, at the very least they reward merit and not social status. The reason they invited me to join their ranks is because I'd sparred with some of their crack troops and won through my own sheer skill. Being an insider in the organization will make getting revenge much easier, as it removes many of life's complications, so what's not to love?",
                "More About Eula: IV": "The name Lawrence only became a social stigma after the clan fell from grace. It was once an honor to be called a Lawrence, but unfortunately, most people have forgotten about that part of history. The Grand Master says that I am performing rather well as a knight, and that if it's not enough to restore the honor of the Lawrence name, it's certainly a strong rebuttal against the one-sided opinions so many people throw around. I'm quite satisfied with that appraisal.",
                "More About Eula: V": "If my family members refuse to change their corrupt ways, or worse, continue to cause active harm in Mondstadt... I should be the one to end them, along with the Lawrence name itself. For once, it'd be a family obligation I'd actually enjoy. And once the deed was done, I'd be free to pick any name I wanted. Or even let you pick one for me!",

Sipping a nice cold drink, sitting in a canyon feeling the biting wind howl past my face, or diving into the lake at the foot of Dragonspine... Waiting for you to stroll by unsuspectingly, so I can sneak up behind you and drag you down into the icy depths...",
                "Eula's Troubles": "Sometimes, when it's busy in the tavern, they ask me to share a table with other customers. But once they find out that I'm a Lawrence, suddenly everyone gets indignant and provocative, and starts trying to bait me out in some way. I just want to have a drink, is that too much to ask!?",
                "Favorite Food": "I like making my own treats. Not always your typical sweet treats, though. For example, a Chilled Tomato and Aspic Jelly Egg Roll pairs very nicely with an ice-cold glass of Berry & Mint Punch. The most important thing is that they leave the people who like eating them with big smiles on their faces.",
                "Least Favorite Food": "I can't stand a rich broth. The flavor is too overpowering, it's so filling you can't train or fight afterward, and also, it doesn't really work as field rations... Simply put, broth and I are sworn enemies!",

When your day of reckoning comes, see how long you can fend me off with it... It'll make the whole thing much more exciting.",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Intro": "My fighting skills just got a whole lot stronger... But I shouldn't get too conceited just yet. There are some truly formidable knights among our ranks, and I must outperform them immeasurably if I wish to defeat them and avenge my clan!",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up": "Good! With this much power, I daresay even the Acting Grand Master herself would be no match for me!",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Climax": "How strange... In the time I've spent with you, my strength seems to have improved exceptionally quickly. I suppose I was rather fortunate to make an enemy of you. I'd better dig my teeth in to make sure you can't get away!",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion": "Excellent! The unstoppable power of an immovable glacier dwells within me now and no grand master, acting or otherwise, can stand in my way! There is no time to delay. I must devise my plan, and unleash my attack! Once I have crushed the Knights of Favonius beneath my heel, my next target... is you. Don't try to run. Stand beside me and witness all that must come to pass."

            "Personality": "A wandering samurai from Inazuma who is currently with Liyue's Crux Fleet. A gentle and carefree soul whose heart hides a great many burdens from the past.\n\nKazuha is a polite and well-spoken person. Unlike other noble Inazuman clan members, he prefers going out and traveling rather than staying put indoors, something that he is able to do due to the seizure of his clan home. He once roamed  peacefully as a modest wanderer for a good portion of his life, teaching himself bladework and picking up other skills. Never seeking luxury, he is instead easily pleased just by sleeping on a sun-warmed rock. The time he has spent outdoors makes him attuned to nature and the wind, being able to \"hear\" and \"smell\" everything around him with absolute clarity. He can sense dangers, read people and track them down in an instant no matter how well they try to conceal it. Due to this sensitivity he prefers calm weather and never stays in one place for too long, having trouble sleeping for the former and having his skills stagnate for the latter.\n\nKazuha firmly believes that everyone is entitled to their hopes and dreams and that no one has the right to take them, not even a god. For this reason, he opposes the  and those who support her. Despite his values, he isn't prideful and can acknowledge the strong fighting prowess and honorable conduct of those he personally disagrees with. He sees his friend's duel as honorable and noble, but also considers his subsequent execution by the Shogun to be both fair and justified. Kazuha is determined in his goals, pursuing them with thoroughness and cunning, but he also takes his time and is easygoing. He is very reflective and thoughtful about all matters, frequently pondering about various topics in his travels. He holds his relationships in high regard, immediately coming out of hiding for  and forever grateful to  and  for taking him in when he needed shelter. Kazuha frequently warns others of coming storms and possible trouble. He happily does simple errands, offers advice, and is willing to help others.\n\nAfter the death of his friend and joining the  he was quiet and wouldn't speak to any of his crewmates, but he eventually warmed up to them and according to Beidou is fairly chatty. Kazuha has a poetic side and enjoys penning haikus, though he claims to not be especially talented at it. As a result of both traveling many places and sailing for long periods of time, Kazuha has grown particularly fond of readily available grilled fish and takes the time to prepare and finish his food slowly. While he is not picky about what he eats, he does not appreciate rushed meals or lazy cooking methods. His most prized possession is his sword that he keeps with him at all times, a source of pride for Kazuha as both an Inazuman and a samurai. He is also incredibly fond of red maple leaves, finding them beautiful and enjoys seeing them rain during autumn. When unable to view such sights, he frequently collects and carries them as a memento to ease any homesickness."

Dignified and elegant, as well as wise and strong.\nAyaka is a kind-hearted girl with a pleasant temperament who treats others with politeness and courtesy. She holds the people of Inazuma dear to her heart and often goes out of her way to personally assist in all kinds of matters; being a member of the Yashiro Commission, she feels that she must meet the people's needs. She is a perfectionist with an earnest personality. Her dedication often moves people, and those close to her gave her the honorary title of Shirasagi Himegimi |ja_rm=Shirasagi no Himegimi|ja_tl=White Heron Princess}}. People in the neighborhood always talk about her with sincere admiration.\n\nThanks to the influence of Ayaka's excellent upbringing, her heart is as pure as crystallized ice. Just like the splendid colors reflected as the ice crystals spin in the winter air, such is Ayaka's spirit. While the people of Inazuma love her, it is also well known that she has very few friends due to her upbringing —  is her only known friend until she met the . She is also busy to the point that she doesn't have much free time, to begin with, so she has trouble mingling with others. When not burdened with her duties, she shows a tender, cute side to her.\n\nBut if you want to capture a heart hanging high in the sky, you must have the ability to climb up the clouds. In other words, Ayaka is eager to associate with people capable of achieving great feats — in her eyes, friendships are dictated by fate, the same way she was destined to wield her frost-covered sword.HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/416398 As graceful as the frost drifting in the wind, as elegant as a heron perched in a courtyard]"

                "More About Kamisato Ayaka: II": "The Kamisato Clan once suffered a major blow when we failed to protect a swordsmith of national significance. We were harassed by the Fatui, we lost many of our people, and we received a great deal of criticism. It all aged Father greatly, and severely damaged the Kamisato Clan's standing within the Shogunate. Brother has worked tirelessly to reverse the trend since he assumed leadership, but although our clan's position is now restored and the Yashiro Commission is unified once more, we still rely on Brother to make the decisions on all matters of any importance.",
                "More About Kamisato Ayaka: III": "The art of blade forging taught by the Shogun varies based on astrology, application, materials used, the furnace conditions, individual personalities, and elemental changes. These differences between smiths is what gave rise to the Raiden Gokaden. Swordsmiths capable of forging renowned blades are seen as spiritual personnel with sacred abilities, and as such they should be managed by the Yashiro Commission, which oversees all cultural, artistic, and ceremonial affairs. So naturally, the swordsmith's betrayal is the fault of ineffectual management by the Kamisato Clan.",
                "More About Kamisato Ayaka: IV": "My mother was the most incredible person. She was always so dignified and elegant, always smiling, no matter what situation she might be facing. She had so much to deal with in the clan on so many levels, but she took it all in stride — it was like nothing could ever faze her. Everything about her was perfect, and I say that without exaggerating. *sigh* But the moment she passed away, I realized... I couldn't hide behind my mother any longer. I wasn't little Ayaka any more.",
                "More About Kamisato Ayaka: V": "What I want to say next is perhaps not befitting of a member of the Inazuma Shogunate, Yashiro Commission, Kamisato Clan, but... unless I am mistaken, I trust that you will not take issue with this slight departure from convention on my part... That is to say... I'm a little tired, may I rest my head on your shoulder? Just for a moment.",

                "Kamisato Ayaka's Troubles: Desires": "Openness is something I find very difficult. I constantly have to remind myself that as a lady of the Kamisato Clan, there are countless people watching and countless expectations to live up to. I must be a model of exemplary conduct at all times. But even so, shouldn't I still follow my dreams? Shouldn't I... share my true feelings with you?",

In honor of your birthday, please allow me to perform a fan dance for you.",

Even if the subject is well-known to me, I am able to gain a deeper level of appreciation for it.\n\t\t- Traveler: I feel the same way.\n\t- Traveler: Let's talk about natural scenery.\n\t\t- Kamisato Ayaka: Talking about the beauty of nature, it is important to mention that the people of Inazuma believe that everything has its own spiritual essence.\n\t\t- Kamisato Ayaka: Even though we might be familiar with the way nature looks on the surface, each type of scenery evokes a different kind of \"feeling.\"\n\t\t- Kamisato Ayaka: At least, that's a romantic way of approaching this topic.\n\t\t- Traveler: I feel the same way.\n\t- Kamisato Ayaka: \"Camellia petals fall to the ground, scattered among the raindrops of yesterday.\"\n\t- Kamisato Ayaka: ...\n\t- Kamisato Ayaka: Just reading it makes me sentimental.

Would you like to exchange views on the art of tea-making?\n\t- Kamisato Ayaka: In other words... Do you want to try my home-made matcha?\n\t- Kamisato Ayaka: I have read in a book before that Mondstadt and Liyue each have their own, unique tea cultures.\n\t- Kamisato Ayaka: But when it comes to the intricacies of tea-making, the people of Inazuma also have their insights.\n\t- Kamisato Ayaka: I'd like you to try some authentic Inazuma Matcha and tell me what you think!\n\t- Kamisato Ayaka: ...Perhaps your feedback will also deepen my understanding of the tea ceremony.\n\t\t- Traveler: I'm pretty sure that someone of your status shouldn't be making tea for me.\n\t\t\t- Kamisato Ayaka: Please don't say that.\n\t\t\t- Kamisato Ayaka: You're the one who's embarked on epic journeys to distant places and achieved many great feats.\n\t\t\t- Kamisato Ayaka: The title of \"the daughter of the Kamisato Clan\" and involvement in the Yashiro Commission pales in comparison to the depths of your experiences.\n\t\t\t- Kamisato Ayaka: More importantly... I hope that, between the two of us, we need not be concerned with our identities...\n\t\t\t- Kamisato Ayaka: I'll just think of you as... my closest confidant.\n\t\t- Traveler: Let me make some desserts to go along with the tea.\n\t\t\t- Kamisato Ayaka: ...Really?!\n\t\t\t- Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem...

When I was young, he would always smile no matter what I said to him, and so I thought that everything I said was correct. So I kept talking, and he would keep smiling. Later, I found out that he was smiling because he couldn't hear clearly, but... as long as he's truly happy, I'll keep talking to him.",

Misunderstandings that arise from saying things wrongly can be resolved if you just talk more, but if you say nothing, the other person won't understand what you mean, and they can't get closer to you.",

She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has \"eternity\" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty.",
                "Something to Share:": "Did you know? A lot of the fireworks used during 's Lantern Rite were purchased from our shop. I made them to order before asking Beidou to ship them to Liyue. Exports like these aren't allowed under the , but... How can there be festivals without fireworks?",
                "Something to Share: Cycles": "\"When the last sparks of the fireworks have disappeared into the sky, they turn into rain and snow, and will fall upon the earth again, nourishing the land and nurturing humanity, so that someday they can be sent up into the sky again and display their magnificence.\" Of the many stories my father told me, this one is my favorite.",
                "Something to Share: Spots of Light": "Did you ever try to step on a spot of light before as a child? You know, those patches on the ground created when the sunlight passes through the leaves. I once thought that it would disappear if I stepped on it, but it would always jump onto my foot instead. I tried and tried and tried, but I never succeeded... Quite the sore loser I was, then — sitting on a rock, sighing to myself and thinking, \"Ah, so there are things in this world that can't be stepped on...\"",
                "Interesting Things": "While squatting next to some children and watching them catch goldfish during one summer festival, I suddenly had a thought: could I make fireworks that could go off on the surface of the water? Thus, the \"Goldfish Fireworks\" were born! They can swim here and there, emit multi-colored lights, and they can even spit bubbles! I never thought that it would actually work, but I guess wonders never cease.",
                "About": "The courier from Komaniya Express? She's super reliable and really quick on her feet! Ingredients used in coloring the fireworks always run out quickly, but she always delivers a new batch right when I need them! I gave her a firework once as a thank-you gift, but she was too scared to light it, saying that she got spooked once by the sound of fireworks. Hehe, so I told her to find a nice viewing spot far away and set it off for her.",
                "About : Seriousness": "We cooperate a lot due to work. Unlike people in the other two Commissions, she always lets me finish speaking and answers me seriously without showing any impatience. I'd say that the word \"ladylike\" was practically made just for her.",
                "About : Baths": "We once discussed matters concerning the summer festival deep into the night. We were both really tired, and I invited her to go take a bath. But when she heard that it involved many people bathing in the same pool, she went red in an instant! That was when I first learned that noble ladies can't use public baths.",
                "About : Duels": "Oh, he may look scary, but he is very popular with the children. However, he can be very competitive. Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?",

Its contents can only be understood by our family, and it records the specific formula of the fireworks that were ordered. Whether ten years or a hundred years pass, our family can make exactly the same fireworks as they did in the past so long as the client brings us that note.",
                "More About Yoimiya: III": "The loveliest fireworks go along with the most wondrous moments. Tiny little emotions that can easily slip away are captured within these fireworks and passed down in a different form. The notes we give our clients are like a key that awaits those who wish to open a gate to commemorate the past. We at Naganohara are the keepers of that gate.",
                "More About Yoimiya: IV": "Every moment of the summer festival is a moving tale. Those who meet under the light of fireworks grow up, mature, and grow old. When they set off the same fireworks as they did in the beginning, the skies reflect that same image from years ago... Fireworks are not eternal, but I believe that the wonderful emotions behind them should walk alongside Inazuma into eternity.",
                "More About Yoimiya: V": "I shan't tell the final tale, I think. Instead, let's watch the fireworks together in silence. You can record the beautiful scenery and all the things you wanna say down. Not that this is the end, of course. On the contrary, I believe that our story is only just beginning.",

Her height is something she's deeply unsatisfied with, believing that sleep can replenish all her energy and help her grow taller.YouTube: [https://youtu.be/l8YXe7EkmoU&t=2401s Version 2.0 Special Program] In order to live by this principle and have as much time to nap as possible, she honed her ninjutsu to perfection.\n\nWhile she is particularly renowned for her apparent laziness, the members of the Shuumatsuban know that she is loyal to their cause as she would never go against their principles and wouldn't slack off on extremely important matters. Ayaka believes that Sayu's laziness came from her sensei's abrupt departure, as she looked up to them and when they left, became lost and confused.\n\nOf course, from Sayu's point of view, this so-called \"laziness\" is just better time allocation which allows her to focus on things... like sleeping and growing taller. She does not like it when people pat her head, believing that doing so impedes her growth. She tolerates headpats from both the  and , although the latter is out of fear of retaliation by the Guuji.\n\nWhile a particularly skilled ninja, Sayu usually handles reconnaissance and other miscellaneous tasks. While she is trained in combat, the arts she learned were mostly intended for stealth and evasion. She appreciates the Traveler's company, willing to work harder for their sake. While dressed as a mujina, who she finds extremely adorable, Sayu becomes angered whenever people call her a tanuki, even going as far as to attack them."

This is one change that I shall not contest.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?\n\t- Ei: Yes, I just so happen to have something that I would like to ask you.\n\t- Traveler: Oh really?

Though your attempts may fail, you will not give up future attempts because of a temporary setback.\n\t\t- Ei: By making adjustments along the way, you compile what you've learned and accumulate experience.\n\t\t- Ei: ...Is that what you mean?\n\t- Traveler: The most important ingredient is hope.\n\t\t- Ei: Hope?\n\t\t- Ei: I would've never expected that trying to make desserts taste better was an expression of hope.\n\t\t- Ei: But no...

Bold, decisive, and skilled in battle.\n\nDespite being an adopted member of the Kujou Clan, she is immensely loyal to the Shogun's rule and tirelessly works to create the eternity that the Shogun desires, even if she does not live to see it herself. Those who speak to her note that she has a ruthless, yet efficient and stern attitude, fitting for her position in the Tenryou Commission. Her devotion to the Shogun's cause and her honorable conduct has gained her the respect of those under her command. She prefers doing everything herself when possible; compared to other Tenryou generals, she participates in battle alongside her men (and head-on attacks as a result) rather than remaining at the back. She despises dishonorable conduct and those who betray the Shogun's will.\n\nSara's dedication to the Shogun seems to stem from the fact that she believes the Shogun saved her from death when she was bestowed an Electro Vision as she was falling a great height during a battle. This action not only led to her life being spared but to the young tengu being adopted into the Kujou Clan and an unbreakable devotion to the Electro Archon. Although Sara appreciates  adopting her, she expresses a sense of loneliness in that she can tell he doesn't truly regard her as family and doesn't treat her the same way he treats his biological children.\n\nShe enjoys quick and easy-filling foods, but dislikes sweets because they put her at ease, something which she finds unfitting for her duties."

I seldom have the opportunity to speak with others, so perhaps it'd be better for you to start and I answer.\n\t- Kujou Sara: Alright, ask away.\n\t- Traveler: This kinda feels like taking an exam, it's making me nervous.\n\t\t- Kujou Sara: Hmm?\n\t\t- Kujou Sara: Interesting. Your expression reminds me of my subordinates when they are giving a report.\n\t\t- Kujou Sara: But I should remind you that I've never viewed you as a subordinate.\n\t- Traveler: Don't you have anything you'd like to ask me?\n\t\t- Kujou Sara: I do, but if I ask, then you must reply.\n\t\t- Kujou Sara: If you fail to do so, then you will receive the due punishment. Have you made up your mind?\n\t- Traveler: Uh...\n\t- Kujou Sara: *sigh* It's difficult to converse with me, isn't it?\n\t- Kujou Sara: To be honest, I've been studying methods of discourse lately in hopes of altering my stern appearance.\n\t- Kujou Sara: However, there are many subtleties in communication, it is difficult to grasp in such a short time.\n\t- Kujou Sara: If mastering conversation is akin to the skill of archery, then I am confident I can improve with more practice.\n\t- Traveler: Yes, you will certainly get better with practice.\n\t- Kujou Sara: Hm.

I just thought it would be nice to have a companion.\n\t- Kujou Sara: The commission is a whirlwind of people and unexpected complications, so I often relish opportunities to get away for assignments in the field.\n\t- Kujou Sara: Whenever I think about it, I can only conclude that I have no time to care for a pet.

You can determine their mood just by looking at their wagging tail, right?\n\t- Kujou Sara: I have no experience in this matter. I'm not entirely sure if I'm qualified to be a pet's \"master.\"\n\t- Kujou Sara: However, because this is a matter between the two of us, you must also hold up your end of the bargain.\n\t- Kujou Sara: Hm, to make things easier for you, I will take responsibility for the most difficult part... playing and interacting with it.\n\t- Traveler: So you mean that I'll have to take care of its...\n\t- Kujou Sara: Exactly. You will be responsible for feeding and cleaning up after it. That's all.\n\t- Kujou Sara: Oh, but first and foremost, we must come up with a memorable name for our pet.\n\t- Kujou Sara: There is no rush, we can discuss it further when we have some ideas to share.\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Morning, Sara!\n\t- Kujou Sara: Morning, Traveler.\n\t- Kujou Sara: I have already completed five sets of bow exercises.

Fostered by an expert hunter, she trained to hunt with cat-like grace and deadly accuracy – but the things she most wanted to learn, he could not teach her. Most of all, she burned to know the circumstances of her birth – who her parents were, and why she was shunned by the tribe. Her quest for answers swept her into a wider and more dangerous world than she ever could have imagined. She encountered strange and powerful new tribes, ancient ruins rife with mysteries, and dangerous enemies, both human and machine. Eventually she learned that her origins and destiny were deeply tied to the fate of the world itself, and fought an epic battle to save it against the evil forces of an artificial intelligence from the ancient past. She thought that this would be the end of her journey. But there is always more to an adventurer's tale. She has now come to Teyvat in search of a new challenges.

Can't believe they really exist here.\n\t- Aloy: But whatever the crisis may be, you always step forward and join up with those who want to fight back, don't you?\n\t- Aloy: It's because of people like you that both cities were able to survive and prevail.\n\t- Traveler: I only made a small contribution...\n\t- Aloy: If that's what you call a small contribution, I think it might take saving the whole world to count as a major one.\n\t- Aloy: Seriously, though, if the world ever does need saving, bring me with you.\n\t- Aloy: I've saved a world once before.

When we've been out on the hunt in the past, I've noticed you've actually got an edge over me.\n\t- Aloy: How did you learn to hunt like you do? Or rather... who taught you?\n\t- Traveler: I guess I'm self-taught.\n\t- Traveler: Nothing fancy, I'm afraid...\n\t- Aloy: Ha. And modest about it too. So I guess you started out with natural talent and then worked at it relentlessly.\n\t- Aloy: Plus, you go on all these adventures to hone your skills.

These are then issued to the troops. ...It does seem at present like they're somewhat over-reliant on the directives, which worries me...

After years of studying the art of war, I can't help but consider all the strategic points upon arriving in a new place like this.\n\t- Sangonomiya Kokomi: Where would the enemy troops set up camp? From which direction could they mount an assault? And what strategies should we implement to counter these factors?\n\t- Sangonomiya Kokomi: We need a barricade here... another sentry tower there... I began to instinctively consider all these things when I first arrived here.\n\t- Traveler: It's quite safe inside the Serenitea Pot, you know.\n\t- Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... Yes, I eventually realized that I was overthinking things.\n\t- Sangonomiya Kokomi: After residing here for a while, I've grown more accustomed to the scenery and my mind has gradually come to be at peace.\n\t- Sangonomiya Kokomi: If you ask me, I would say this is almost an ideal place. I can easily separate myself from the outside world and enjoy some time to myself...\n\t- Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, but could I rent a room to use as a command post? I need a place to lay out my maps and battle scenarios.\n\t- Traveler: Of course you can.\n\t- Sangonomiya Kokomi: Splendid. I would certainly like to stay here for some time.

They were like gems to me.\n\t- Sangonomiya Kokomi: I remember thinking at the time that it would be perfect to work as an adviser someday.

                "About": "You've had a run-in with Eula Lawrence before, huh? All I know is that their  are about the worst-tempered people you could ever meet. You're better off steering clear of them if you can help it. Ah, now I'm in a Mondstadt mood again... The memories.",
                "About the : Comparison": "In my homeland of Mondstadt, almost everyone has great reverence for the Anemo Archon, . But people in Inazuma feel a little differently toward the Shogun. How can I put this... They feel love, respect, gratitude... but also fear.",
                "About the Raiden Shogun: The Unknown": "Honestly, I don't harbor any resentment toward the Shogun. Yes, she almost took my Vision away, but ultimately that's just because of her unique perspective. Everyone has their own perspective, there's nothing strange about that. The only thing I don't understand is her goal in doing so. What does she imagine eternity really looks like for Inazuma? And why is sacrificing her people's aspirations so necessary to achieve it? I can neither understand nor agree with her approach.",
                "More About Thoma: I": "Anything I can lend a hand with? If something needs doing around the house or you're having some interpersonal strife, just say the word. Hmm? A conversation... I see, I see. That's a little different from what I'm used to, but I'm all for it.",
                "More About Thoma: II": "I'm not from Inazuma originally — I think I've told you that before, right? I took a boat all the way here from Mondstadt, found I liked the place, and was also lucky enough to meet the wonderful Kamisato siblings, so I just ended up staying.",
                "More About Thoma: III": "I get homesick once in a while, too, so I completely relate to all the international merchants on Ritou. I try to look out for them as much as I can. The difference between us is that they see themselves as just passing by, and have no intention of trying to integrate here. And because that's how they think, it becomes their reality. The majority of Inazumans will never see them as anything more than outsiders.",
                "More About Thoma: IV": "For some of the more conservatively minded people in Inazuma, the idea of an outlander working as a retainer for one of the Commissions is unthinkable. So there was a time when I was not that welcome here. I'm pretty sure I'd have been deported a long time ago without a couple of Kamisatos fighting my corner. I couldn't let the clan down after they'd been so kind to me, so I put in a lot of honest work, and eventually, everyone was finally able to accept me.",
                "More About Thoma: V": "I'm not sure if I should get into this, but... Ah, hopefully you won't mind. I went through a period where I really just wanted to go home — Mondstadt is my homeland, after all. But I was torn... It wouldn't be easy to leave Inazuma behind, either. I mean, just look how good the people here have been to me. The Kamisato Clan always has a room for me, and there are people I've met here that are like family. So, I went back and forth over it, and ultimately decided I'd stay in Inazuma. When I'm missing Mondstadt... I can just chat with you. You don't mind my rambling, do you?",
                "Thoma's Hobbies": "I've been really getting into stories about the unnatural recently. Especially ones about shapeshifting youkai — they're so fascinating. Before that, I was really into ninjutsu for a while, and before that... Hmm? You think I'm not dedicated enough? N—No! It's not like that, you got me all wrong!",
                "Thoma's Troubles": "I'm in a real pickle here. The chief is hosting a banquet for his friends tonight, and he says he wants me to splurge a little by cooking some . The only problem is that for the last two days, I haven't been able to buy crab anywhere! So, what, am I gonna have to dive into the ocean and grab them myself?",
                "Favorite Food": "Without a doubt, my favorite food is . I like cooking up a big, delicious potful for everyone to share. It's a recipe for a good time.",
                "Least Favorite Food": "As far as food is concerned, I'm fine with anything. If we're counting beverages, though... I'm not very good with alcohol. Don't laugh, and before you say it — yes, I've wondered what this says about my identity as a Mondstadter. But, y'know... too much alcohol is bad for you, anyway. So not drinking is a good thing.",

                "Birthday": "Quick, come with me! I remembered it's your birthday, obviously, so I thought I'd throw you a proper party. There's food, there's drinks, and I invited a whole bunch of your friends, too. Hey, this is your birthday we're talking about! I wasn't about to let you spend it all alone!",

                "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up": "It feels like... a fire inside of me has just begun to burn.",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Climax": "I have all of this power, but how should I use it? I need to give this one some serious thought.",

Believe me, I can feel at home almost anywhere.\n\t- Thoma: By the way, I really like what you've done with the place... Especially that funny little bird at the entrance...\n\t- Traveler: That's Tubby, a teapot spirit.\n\t\t- Thoma: Gotcha, Tubby the Teapot Spirit... Wait, what?\n\t\t- Thoma: I've heard my share of stories, everything from fox envoys, to bake-danuki, to tengu warriors... But a teapot spirit? That's a new one.\n\t\t- Thoma: Hmm, interesting. So, that teapot youkai... I mean, spirit. Teapot spirit. Did you catch it yourself?\n\t\t- Traveler: It's a long story. Rest assured, Tubby is no youkai.\n\t- Traveler: That's Tubby, my butler bird.\n\t\t- Thoma: Gotcha, Tubby the Butler Bird... Wait, what?\n\t\t- Thoma: You're saying you've got a bird that's smart enough to be a butler? It's not some kind of youkai or anything... Is it?\n\t\t- Thoma: Heh, you never cease to impress me. I mean, taming youkai? Who knew you had that kind of talent!\n\t\t- Traveler: It's a long story. Rest assured, Tubby is no youkai.\n\t- Thoma: Not a youkai? So... just out of curiosity, this Tubby doesn't happen to be some sort of god or anything, does it?\n\t- Thoma: That would spell the end for me...

The atmosphere here's really relaxed. It's perfect for chatting the day away.\n\t- Thoma: By the way, I've been hoping to show you around the Grand Narukami Shrine when we get the chance.\n\t- Thoma: The Sacred Sakura at the shrine is in bloom year-round. Seeing the falling blossoms dance in the wind is quite a sight to behold... definitely a surefire way to make you fall in love with Inazuma.\n\t- Traveler: Yes, I've seen them before.\n\t- Traveler: I'd love to join you next time.\n\t- Thoma: Haha, great!\n\t- Thoma: And speaking of the Grand Narukami Shrine, one word of advice... Don't ever attack any of the kitsune nearby.\n\t- Thoma: Not that you'd ever dream of doing something like that... would you?\n\t- Traveler: Of course not, I always respect the wildlife.\n\t\t- Thoma: Ah, that's good. I always knew that you were a kindhearted person.\n\t- Traveler: Why, what's the worst that could happen?\n\t\t- Thoma: Huh, you're not seriously considering it, are you? Trust me, don't let curiosity get the best of you. Attacking a kitsune is bad luck.\n\t- Thoma: I know an old lady who loves telling stories about the unnatural. She told me that someone was once sentenced to \"judgment by lightning\" after attacking one of the kitsune near the shrine.\n\t- Thoma: Kitsune are highly favored by the Grand Narukami, so I guess the offender only got what was coming to them.\n\t- Thoma: Regardless, you should probably try not to provoke any animals you encounter, regardless of the species.\n\t- Thoma: All plants and creatures equally deserve our respect.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?\n\t- Thoma: Actually, I was hoping to find a nice, open area and invite you to do some skygazing together.\n\t- Thoma: Something about the sky here seems clearer than anywhere else. It makes me feel... peaceful inside.\n\t- Thoma: Don't get me wrong, sunset in Inazuma is impressive, too, but somehow it feels a little more... somber than what you have here.\n\t- Traveler: Well, we are inside an adeptus' teapot, after all.\n\t\t- Thoma: Huh, you're right... which is already pretty astonishing. To think that the two of us along with a whole expanse of sky can be packed inside a tiny little teapot.\n\t- Traveler: I know what you mean.\n\t\t- Thoma: Really? You do? It's great that you know how I feel.\n\t- Thoma: Ahhhh...\n\t- Thoma: Even if this crystal-blue sky is just a teapot's illusion, a moment of pure tranquility is a great thing all the same.\n\t- Thoma: Haha, I guess I always try to see the positive side of things.\n\t- Traveler: I appreciate that about you, Thoma.\n\t- Traveler: That's why you can live a happy life.\n\t- Thoma Haha, thanks for that.\n\t- Thoma: On a more serious note, though you may not want to show it...

While he considers himself to be mostly inexperienced due to his age, he tries his best to help out with any problems that may arise. He is comfortable speaking with others apart from , as the kitsune frequently talks in a manner that he finds himself completely flustered to the point that he instinctively hides from her if given the chance.\n\nGorou has dog blood in his veins and shares several of their traits, including the ability to mostly understand what they are saying from a single bark. His ears also twitch accordingly depending on what emotion is evoked. If he is particularly happy, his tail begins wagging, something that he considers embarrassing, yet is unable to control and is sometimes oblivious to. He also wishes to be taller and more muscular so that his soldiers can identify him easily on the battlefield.\n\nHe is fond of sweets due to their rarity in military life, but avoids onions as they make his eyes tear up.

Countless battles in, I'm still here, so I guess these hands and my will to survive were both strong enough to see me through. Some even say that no matter how dire the battle may be, everyone will emerge unscathed as long as they follow me.

The rations we have in the field are intended to be simple, effective, and quick, and are seldom served with any seasonings at all, let alone sugar... It's probably the most precious commodity of all. Ah, what can I say — I guess I just have a sweet tooth!",

One time, the logistics division added ground onion to my food and I bawled in front of everyone, right there at the mess table... *sigh* Talk about embarrassing.

Don't worry, I'm exceedingly good at adapting to new environments.\n\t- Gorou: There've been times in the past when I've had to make do with a rock for a pillow, or just find a patch of grass to lie down on. In the army, you learn how to sleep well wherever you are.\n\t- Traveler: So do you feel that life here is too relaxed?\n\t\t- Gorou: Haha, why would you think that?\n\t\t- Gorou: If your bowstring is always drawn tight, it will eventually snap.\n\t\t- Gorou: Relaxation is an essential part of improving as a fighter. So as far as I'm concerned, this place is the perfect antidote to the tension of battle!\n\t- Traveler: Well, you can finally take it easy here...\n\t\t- Gorou: *sigh*... Seems so.\n\t\t- Gorou: Time of peace is hard to come by. I will cherish every moment of it.\n\t- Gorou: Which brings me to you. I wanted to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for everything you've done for me. Thank you!\n\t- Gorou: You've always been genuine with me, it truly warms my heart.\n\t- Gorou: Anyway, don't worry, I'm not here to just take advantage and lounge around. I'm ready to switch to combat mode at a moment's notice!\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?\n\t- Gorou: Sure!\n\t- Gorou: How about I tell you some stories from my time in the resistance? I can think of a few you're not likely to hear from anybody else...\n\t- Traveler: I'd love to know more...\n\t- Gorou: Alright! The truth is, not every soldier that joins the resistance goes through formal training, so new soldiers make small mistakes from time to time.\n\t- Gorou: For example, one time during a mock expedition, one of the new soldiers didn't store his rations carefully enough. They went bad, and he ended up eating nothing but Radishes for two whole weeks.\n\t- Gorou: Another time during a scouting operation, a new soldier mistook animal trails for enemy trails. They ended up playing cat and mouse with a forest boar for three whole days...\n\t- Gorou: Thankfully, these were just small oversights, and never caused any serious consequences. On the contrary, we often have a good laugh about these things during our down time.\n\t- Gorou: But when I think about it, I'm sure we would avoid issues like these if we reformed some of our guidelines.\n\t- Gorou: We should be mixing veteran soldiers and newer soldiers together. This way, veteran soldiers can act as mentors and share their experience with the newer soldiers...\n\t- Gorou: Uh, my apologies, I began thinking out loud there!\n\t- Gorou: I can go over these reforms some other time! Right now, I'm chatting with you, so I should keep it light.\n\t- Traveler: I want to hear more about the Ever-Victorious General.\n\t- Gorou: ...You want to hear my story?\n\t- Gorou: Uhh...\n\t- Gorou: Soldiers love boasting about my military achievements to other people, but I always feel that talking about my own experience gives the impression I'm boasting.\n\t- Traveler: I want to hear it!\n\t- Traveler: I would never think you're boasting.\n\t- Gorou: Heh, you know I can't say no to you, don't you? ...Wait, that's why you asked, isn't it?\n\t- Gorou: Heh... Alright, I guess there's no way out of this one...\n\t- Gorou: Let me think... Okay, let me tell you the thrilling tale of my one-man scouting mission to the north of Nazuchi Beach.\n\t- Gorou: Here's what I remember from that day...\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?\n\t- Gorou: Yeah! I heard from Tubby the Butler Bird that she can change the terrain to whatever you want.\n\t- Gorou: So, could you build a really tall mountain? The steeper the better — I want it to be a tough climb.\n\t- Gorou: Then, let's you and I have a race to the top!\n\t- Traveler: No problem.\n\t- Gorou: Wow, you didn't take much persuading! Thank you!\n\t- Gorou: I used to go mountain climbing with my resistance comrades all the time. It was a great way to test our physical limits while also having some fun together... I have so many treasured memories.\n\t- Gorou: But something tells me that the chance to climb a mountain with you would become the happiest memory of them all.\n\t- Gorou: In fact, I would love to share every happy moment with you.\n\t- Traveler: I understand.\n\t- Traveler: Gorou, I also want to thank you.\n\t- Gorou: Hah, you're too kind! Alright... how about we find a relatively safe mountain trail and see who makes it to the top the fastest? Are you up to the challenge!?\n\t- Gorou: The loser has to treat the winner to a three-course meal... and at least one of the courses has to be dessert...\n\t- Traveler: I... just want to touch your tail...\n\t- Gorou: Uh? What a weird request...\n\t- Gorou: But, fine... if you win, of course!\n\t- Traveler: \"I want to use your tail as a pillow when I go to sleep...\n\t- Gorou: What!? My tail... as a pillow...\n\t- Gorou: I... Fine, I'll allow it. But only if you win.\n\t- Gorou: For the sake of my tail, I will give it everything I got! If you're serious about winning this, you're gonna have your work cut out for you!\n\t- Gorou: Right! We should probably warm up first...\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Gorou.\n\t- Gorou: Morning, Traveler!\n\t- Gorou: I've completed my training for the day. If you plan on leaving now, then let me accompany you!\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good night, Gorou.\n\t- Gorou: Good night, Traveler.\n\t- Gorou: Rest well, friend.

This is me we're talking about...\n\t- Arataki Itto: Send me anywhere in the world — anywhere at all — and I guarantee you I'd be able to live there.\n\t- Arataki Itto: I've slept on the streets, down at the dock, deep in the forest... Pretty much everywhere! Of course, comfort-wise, the cells at the Police Station are up there at the top of the list.\n\t- Arataki Itto: That was all before I met you, though.\n\t- Arataki Itto: This place is something else! In fact, I'm gonna go on the record and say that the comfort level here is like 10... No, what am I saying — 100 prison cells rolled into one!\n\t- Traveler: I don't want it to be like any number of prison cells!\n\t\t- Arataki Itto: Why not? They're great!\n\t\t- Arataki Itto: Anyway, look me in the eyes, and listen up, okay? This place is awesome!\n\t- Traveler: You flatter me!\n\t\t- Arataki Itto: Haha! Seriously though, I'm just telling it how it is. I think we're past the point where we need to be polite to each other all the time.\n\t\t- Arataki Itto: If it's okay with you, I might actually make this my main pad. It's a sweet deal, I'm pretty psyched at the idea of crashing here every night...\n\t- Arataki Itto: Anyway... point made, boom. I'm not gonna drag it out like some... granny at a tea party.\n\t- Arataki Itto: But the code of the streets says I should find a way to express my, uh, you know, gratitude... but, I know... I—I can be your bouncer here!\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Do you have time for a chat?\n\t- Arataki Itto: *sigh*... Argh... where do I start...\n\t- Traveler: What's happened?\n\t- Arataki Itto: I've been doing some thinking over the last couple of days about how I keep losing my Onikabuto fights, and, well... I'm starting to think that maybe I should just give it up now.\n\t- Arataki Itto: Maybe it's time to make a clean break, you know? To stop wasting my time on things which just don't matter.\n\t- Traveler: You mean you're...\n\t- Arataki Itto: You bet — I'm giving up Onikabuto fights for good! From this day forward, it's Fireflies all the way, baby!\n\t- Traveler: Maybe the issue isn't about the bugs...\n\t- Arataki Itto: Not about the bugs... like how? Are you saying I should go for a boar instead? Or a bird maybe? Nah... too much hard work!\n\t- Arataki Itto: You do you have a point though — swapping out one kind of bug for another won't necessarily improve my odds of winning...\n\t- Traveler: Maybe it's to do with the people you're playing with...\n\t- Arataki Itto: The people? Nah! No way. Not possible!\n\t- Arataki Itto: The kids I battle with might talk a whole lot, and sure, there's a few pranksters among them — but they're no cheaters!\n\t- Arataki Itto: Anyway, whatever. At the end of the day, I just haven't found the bug for me. Ugh, seems like you can't go looking for a strong companion, you've gotta wait for the right one to come along...\n\t- Arataki Itto: Luckily for me, you're not like them at all: You and I are like an absolute powerhouse together!\n\t- Traveler: ...Also, I'm not a bug!!!\n\t- Arataki Itto: Hahaha, right, there's that too! I was just kidding, of course. My mind never even went there.\n\t- Arataki Itto: If we ever got into a situation where a fight was unavoidable, naturally I'd be the one to take it for the team.\n\t- Arataki Itto: All you'd have to do is stand back and root for me. At the top of your voice, you know, really giving it all you've got. When it comes to the atmosphere, you've gotta go big or go home!\n\t- Arataki Itto: Haha...

Meet him on the street-o, he'll make you kiss his feet-o!\"\n\t- Arataki Itto: Sound good? Haha. Alright, let's practice it together now!\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?\n\t- Arataki Itto: Hey! Perfect timing. There's something I need to talk to you about. Something important. Has to be face to face.\n\t- Arataki Itto: So this, uh, Adventurers' Guild — what kind of things do they do? And which tasks do you normally take?\n\t- Traveler: You want to join the Adventurers' Guild?\n\t- Arataki Itto: Hah, me? No way!\n\t- Arataki Itto: You gotta be there, what, every other day?

You want to help me.\n\t- Arataki Itto: Wait, what do you mean, \"oh right\"!? C'mon, that's hurtful, where's the enthusiasm?\n\t- Arataki Itto: Next time, I don't wanna hear \"oh right, Itto wants to help.\" I wanna hear \"darn right, Itto wants to help\"! Got it?\n\t- Traveler: Thank you...\n\t- Arataki Itto: Ahem... I was hoping for more of a \"sorry, I didn't ask you to help, Itto\" than a \"thank you\"!\n\t- Arataki Itto: I know you've asked other people for help in the past, so why not me, huh? What's that about?\n\t- Arataki Itto: I see you as a member of the Arataki Gang! You do know that, don't you?\n\t- Arataki Itto: Every single member of my gang is like family to me. And, you know... same goes for you.\n\t- Arataki Itto: That makes this a family matter, you get it? Which means, leave it to Itto!\n\t- Arataki Itto: Don't you worry now, I've got your back wherever you go. Whether you're cruising the city or wandering the wilds, my boys will be there!\n\t- Arataki Itto: Ah, except... only in Inazuma. How am I supposed to protect you if you leave?\n\t- Arataki Itto: Hah! Guess it's time for the Arataki Gang to start expanding into other nations!\n\t- Traveler: Don't worry about me, I can look after myself!\n\t- Arataki Itto: Haha, that's the spirit! That's what makes you part of my crew.\n\t- Arataki Itto: Guess that settles it then. When I'm not around, promise me you'll carry on being a champ and living life to the max.\n\t- Arataki Itto: And when I say being a champ — that means kicking some serious butt, alright? I don't care if you're playing card games or you're brawling — no losing! Not to anyone!\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Itto!\n\t- Arataki Itto: Good morning, Traveler! It really is — seriously, I slept like a baby last night, so I am feeling prett-tay pumped this morning!\n\t- Arataki Itto: So, what're you up to today, huh? Need my help with anything? Whatever it is, just say the word and Itto is on the case!\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Goodnight, Itto.\n\t- Arataki Itto: Wait... what? You're hitting the hay already?\n\t- Arataki Itto: Come on, sleep is for the weak! Not champions like you and I!

Despite the adepti's attempts to contain her tendencies, they have only done so by binding her soul with , which suppress her emotions and cause her to have an indifferent personality.\n\nEven with the red ropes suppressing her homicidal tendencies, Shenhe often contemplates the most violent means to eliminate others and is almost always easy to anger, obliterating her surroundings whenever her emotions get the best of her. She throws hostile looks at , believing him to be threatening others. Despite this, Shenhe ultimately wishes to fit in human society and places great trust in the .

                "More About Shenhe: III": "I am the apprentice of multiple adepti and have trained alongside them. After a certain point, however, they stopped teaching me new techniques and started focusing on how to control my intense homicidal urges. Oh, don't be nervous... Yes, craters have been left in the ground, and giant trees have been uprooted. But these things only ever happen in the mountains, far away from civilization, and certainly have never affected innocent lives. Besides, I can control myself now.",
                "More About Shenhe: IV": "My father's intent was to trade my flesh and blood for my mother's life. After he abandoned me in that cave, I still held out hope that he'd come back to rescue me. One day went by. Then two days, three days... I used every ounce of energy in my body to fight off that monster. But as I collapsed on the ground, I finally realized that the day I was waiting for would never come. To this day, I don't which one it is... Was I abandoned because I'm cursed, or is it the way I've been treated in life that has cursed me?",
                "More About Shenhe: V": "Once, I secretly left the mountain and returned to my childhood village without telling my master. But it was deserted, and my father had long since passed away. I suddenly realized that the bond between my relatives and I had been completely severed. And nothing that I'd ever cared about in the past could ever have a future. Ever since then, I have abandoned everything related to the mortal world... That is, until I met you.",
                "Shenhe's Hobbies": "The most important aspect of meditation is stillness. Let go of all agitation, and let the air around you flow into your body. This technique allows me to quickly focus in on myself. I heard from my master that after meditating beyond a certain point, there is no need to adopt the meditation posture anymore. Adepti can meditate even when standing up... I still have much more to improve on.",
                "Shenhe's Troubles": "The fear of losing the people most important to me, and the desire to save them... This kind of feeling makes my heart ache, I've never experienced anything like it before. It's a burden, yes, but it's also... something to hold onto.",
                "Favorite Food": "I've sampled numerous dishes during my time away from the mountains, but the truth is that I don't really remember how they taste. The only dish I can never forget the flavor of is that bowl of noodles I ate at home, so long ago... I shouldn't have to remember that. Why do I have to remember that?",
                "Least Favorite Food": "Chew medicinal herbs for long enough, and you can only taste the bitterness... In all the years I trained under the adepti, I had to abstain from all kinds of things, and to a point, I got used to it. But them... \"The common delights of the mortal realm pose no hindrance to the adepti, thus, we may indulge in all manner of dishes as we please\"... These are the exact words my master said.",

                "Birthday": "I've been told that birthdays are important occasions for most people. They give presents to celebrate the anniversary of the other person's birth. Material possessions aren't really my thing, but... The view of the starry night sky in the mountains is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. I've frozen this lake and turned it into a mirror, so you can appreciate the reflection of the fleeting clouds and distant stars right up close. This is my way of celebrating your birthday...

                "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion": "I once believed that freeing my mind from all agitation was the only way to overcome. But after everything I've experienced recently, I finally understand... Only when the right things weigh on your mind can the desire to protect awaken inside of you. And that turns your power into something... meaningful."

Though their abodes can be uniquely picturesque, they also feel like a lonely and remote paradise.\n\t- Shenhe: But here feels very warm and cozy, and I have a nice person like you to keep me company. I've truly never experienced anything like this.\n\t- Shenhe: What I mean is... I like it here. I will cherish this place and learn to adapt to life here.\n\t- Traveler: Alright, that's good to hear.\n\t- Shenhe: However... there are many pieces of decoration and furniture here that I've never seen before.

Then I suppose you must enjoy chatting, just like my master.\n\t- Shenhe: Alright then, aside from my rigorous training in the adepti arts, my master also taught me the skills of conversation. Though more often than not, she was the only one speaking and I ended up just listening quietly.\n\t- Shenhe: I suppose I should take the opportunity to practice whenever it presents itself. Why don't you start?\n\t- Traveler: What have you learned about making conversation?\n\t- Shenhe: Well... It seems that conversation is a skill that can't be practiced like other arts. There isn't any concrete methodology to mastering it as far as I can tell.\n\t- Shenhe: I only remember my master saying that the purpose of talking is not only to convey information, but also to direct the mood and deepen mutual feelings.\n\t- Traveler: How do you direct the mood?\n\t\t- Shenhe: Well, according to her, you should pick topics of interest to your partner. That's the best way to direct the mood of the conversation.\n\t\t- Shenhe: Before I met you, I wasn't close with anyone. There were barely any topics that would ever spark my interest.\n\t- Traveler: How do you deepen mutual feelings?\n\t\t- Shenhe: I'm quite ashamed, actually, I have no talent for this and my master's expertise hasn't rubbed off on me at all...\n\t\t- Shenhe: The feelings shared between my adepti teachers and me are quite extraordinary. We don't need to converse to deepen our feelings for each other.\n\t\t- Shenhe: And besides them, I have no real friends, which means that I've never had someone with whom to deepen my feelings.\n\t- Traveler: So you mean that...\n\t- Traveler: You don't seem like you enjoy chatting at all...\n\t- Shenhe: Well, whenever my master brought you up as the topic, I'll admit I felt quite... amused.\n\t- Traveler: Me?\n\t- Shenhe: Yes, you. She said that you are widely regarded as a bold and fearless hero, but if people had seen the look of sheer panic on your face when you fell from the first Jade Chamber...\n\t- Traveler: Ah yeah, about that...\n\t- Shenhe: You're blushing. Is this how it feels when the mood of a conversation begins to shift?\n\t- Shenhe: It seems my master's conversation techniques are quite handy after all...\n\t- Shenhe: I've got it, I shall go ask my master all about you. That way, we'll have many more common topics to discuss.\n\t- Traveler: No, uh, please don't do that...\n\t- Shenhe: Oh, I suppose there's no need to go through all that trouble, you're already sitting right here in front of me after all.\n\t- Shenhe: In which case, please, tell me more about yourself. I'll remember everything you say!\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?\n\t- Shenhe: As a matter of fact, I would like something to eat.\n\t- Traveler: Oh, you're hungry?\n\t- Shenhe: Well, no. Not really. I actually just wanted to sit and chat with you over a long meal.\n\t- Shenhe: I heard that sharing a meal is really important to the people of Liyue.\n\t- Shenhe: It's not only about eating, but rather, \"sharing an enjoyable time with those that are important to you.\"\n\t- Shenhe: When everyone gathers together over a meal, that's called a \"get-together,\" right?\n\t- Traveler: That's right, especially during the holidays.\n\t- Shenhe: Like Lantern Rite? I know that everyone is supposed to release Xiao Lanterns during that holiday... a pity that it's only once a year.\n\t- Traveler: There are other holidays, too, you know...\n\t- Traveler: For example, the Moonchase Festival. Everyone gathers to enjoy the moonlight together.\n\t- Shenhe: I see...\n\t- Shenhe: I used to always feel that the holidays had nothing to do with me. But now... there seems to be a longing in my heart for the next holiday to come more quickly.\n\t- Shenhe: I would like to use all that I have learned to celebrate together with you.\n\t- Traveler: I almost didn't realize it, but...\n\t- Traveler: You've made loads of progress...\n\t- Shenhe: I've been growing thanks to your constant guidance. Believe me, I won't forget your kindness.\n\t- Shenhe: And my feelings toward you are not only of gratitude...\n\t- Shenhe: But anyway, let's celebrate the next holiday together!\n\t- Traveler: We'll have a get-together?\n\t- Shenhe: Yes, a big get-together.\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Shenhe.\n\t- Shenhe: Oh, up already, Traveler?\n\t- Shenhe: If those noisy birds woke you up, I'll go silence them right away.\n\t- Shenhe: Huh?

Her style is one-of-a-kind, exquisite and delicate, much like the person herself.\n\nYun Jin is a skilled director, playwright and singer who is well renowned throughout Liyue for her plays, enjoying this passion and going to many lengths to ensure that everyone who watches her performances leaves satisfied. While appearing to be refined and graceful in formal occasions, she is also known to be exceptionally friendly in private. She draws inspiration from many sources for her plays; she enjoys a wide variety of special drinks as one of her pastimes and she can write a play about one if she enjoys it.\n\nDespite enjoying her passion, she also enjoys variety; while she gets along with the troupe in theater-related issues, she frequently clashes with them over personal affairs as she feels that they are too traditional. She is particularly fond of rock 'n' roll, visiting Xinyan and watching her performances at least three times a week no matter how busy she is. Xinyan believes that she comes to visit her due to the finer arts being \"suffocating\". She tries to keep her visits a secret, as her interest in non-traditional music would cause much consternation among her elders."

                "More About Yun Jin: II": "Per the tradition, actors must wrap their hair, put on full-face makeup and an elaborate costume, and make all sorts of other preparations before they take the stage. There's no doubt that an opera star in full attire looks spectacular, but achieving this look is frightfully exhausting. So I perform without hair and makeup whenever I have the option — and if I must perform in full dress, I try to select a costume that isn't too heavy. Fortunately, the good folks at Heyu Tea House are quite lenient with us. Otherwise, we'd be working ourselves to early graves.",
                "More About Yun Jin: III": "At the start of my opera career, I have to say I did let the standing ovations from our audiences go to my head a little. It wasn't long before I developed a captious attitude... If I didn't like the script, or if the stage was too small, or if I thought there weren't enough people in the audience, I would refuse to perform. Looking back now, it was all terribly arrogant of me... my goodness. I shall never let myself become so vain again.",
                "More About Yun Jin: IV": "Now that I think about it, the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has been under my leadership for quite some time now. Before taking it over, I only knew two things: how to write opera and how to perform it on stage. I never gave any thought to how to run a troupe. Becoming the troupe's director gave me a crash course in this unfamiliar area and I've experienced all the highs and lows of working with people along the way... Only now do I understand that life mirrors opera, just as opera reflects life.",
                "More About Yun Jin: V": "Well you know, many of Liyue's legends are centered around stories of gods and the adepti, so most operas focus on the supernatural, too. A prime example would be \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation,\" which we have been performing recently. Long-time opera fans adore this sort of material, but in this age of humanity, I would rather like to tell stories about ordinary people. Yes, how grand it would be to sing about the hopes and dreams of ordinary people for all to hear. I've never shared these thoughts with anyone before... Thank you for listening so patiently.

Does it differ from that of the martial artists we see in Liyue?\n\t- Yun Jin: I've also heard that the swords produced in Inazuma can cut through nearly anything... How do they forge such sharp swords?\n\t- Traveler: The knights of Mondstadt are masters of Favonius Bladework.\n\t\t- Yun Jin: A fighting style that flows like the wind?

I remember that one legend in particular made mention of an adeptus's abode in Jueyun Karst.\n\t- Traveler: An adeptus's abode?\n\t- Yun Jin: Yes, that's right.

She tends to call the Shogun by her true name, Ei. Ei herself also calls Miko by her first name, signifying their closeness and friendship.\n\nDespite her light-hearted, mischievous personality, she showed a more emotional side during the , indicating that she does genuinely care for those in her life and has considered thousands of youkai from across Inazuma to be her friends.

How about I tell you a story from long ago, hmm?\n\t- Traveler: Please, that would be great!\n\t- Traveler: I'd love to hear it!\n\t- Yae Miko: Long, long ago, there was a little child who suddenly turned up at the shrine one day.\n\t- Yae Miko: In her arms she was carrying a little fox on the brink of death. She knelt before Kitsune Saiguu and begged her to save her friend.\n\t- Yae Miko: The child said the fox had started appearing frequently in the village ever since she had fed it some Fried Tofu.\n\t- Yae Miko: But it wasn't long before misfortune struck. Now that the fox had let down its guard, a vicious dog from the village seized the chance to attack, delivering a near-fatal bite. Heart-broken and riddled with guilt, the child decided to bring the injured fox to the shrine for help.\n\t- Yae Miko: Kitsune Saiguu granted her request and agreed to nurse the little fox back to health. Worried that the little girl would be lonely without her companion, Kitsune Saiguu decided to ask another member of her kin to keep the little girl company for a few days. I was the one she asked.\n\t- Traveler: What happened after that?\n\t- Yae Miko: Well, obviously, being the fabulously beautiful fox that I am, it wasn't long before the little girl was crazy about me.\n\t- Yae Miko: Not only would she buy me all sorts of tasty treats to eat, she would pamper me day in and day out. She always wanted me by her side, even when she was sleeping.\n\t- Yae Miko: After two days, the little fox had recovered and I accompanied the girl back to the shrine. Upon our arrival, Kitsune Saiguu asked the girl which fox was her favorite — the one she had made friends with originally, or the new one?\n\t- Yae Miko: She hesitantly looked back and forth between me and her old fox friend.\n\t- Traveler: That would be quite a difficult choice...\n\t- Yae Miko: But when her own fox trotted up and whimpered to her, she finally set me down.\n\t- Yae Miko: \"The fox you gave me is very beautiful, Miss Shrine Maiden, but I still love my old friend the most.\"\n\t- Yae Miko: Finally, the child offered some Fried Tofu to thank me for accompanying her, then left with her little fox friend.\n\t- Traveler: What an amazing story.\n\t- Traveler: Thanks for telling me this story.\n\t- Yae Miko: Hmm? Wait a moment, child. You're not planning to just leave it at that, are you?\n\t- Yae Miko: Come on, I've told you my story — now it's your turn. Shouldn't you offer me something in exchange?\n\t- Traveler: Alright, let me tell you my story.\n\t\t- Yae Miko: Hmm, I suppose that will do.\n\t\t- Yae Miko: But could you try to spice it up a bit? Tell it as if it were a best-seller from Yae Publishing House.\n\t- Traveler: How about I go buy you some Fried Tofu?\n\t\t- Yae Miko: Now you're talking.\n\t\t- Yae Miko: Alright, I'll wait for you here.

But you are far too much fun for that. I can't help but tease you from time to time.\n\t- Traveler: Oh, so it's my fault that you feel the need to tease me!?\n\t- Yae Miko: But of course.\n\t- Yae Miko: If you liken human lives to light novels, every one has its highlights, but also inevitably has many aspects that are similar to all the others.\n\t- Yae Miko: As an observer, I get to see the similarities all the time, which naturally leaves me desiring to see something more unique.\n\t- Yae Miko: Your story is one that has captivated me. I really do have high hopes for you... Please do your best to live up to them, child.\n\t- Traveler: My story? You mean my life story?

I was planning a deep-reaching investigation into the former owner of the Yanshang Teahouse, but our harbinger friend got to him first. He showed up demanding payment of his debt, and also exposed his accounting fraud, which got him thrown in jail. That made it very easy for me to take over Yanshang Teahouse myself, and it's proven to be a very useful base.",

She handles the gang's legal issues and gets them out of trouble and tries her best to compensate for any damages that Itto might have caused with his antics. Her professionalism is noted by the people of , who go to her for advice on various matters and are left impressed as their discussions with her go smoothly and efficiently. While the gang is not on good terms with the , she gets along well with , even giving up her  to her for  the sake of their friendship.\n\nShinobu is on poor terms with her parents, as they had forced her to become a shrine maiden in her youth and felt that they did not care for her well-being along with loathing the job. However, she is still on good terms with her sister . She wears a face mask as to prevent others from getting involved in her personal affairs.\n\nShe is also known to be terrifying when sufficiently angered, often sourced from having her plans disrupted as a result from having to bail out the Arataki Gang from prison. She often uses physical discipline on the gang as a way to discourage further nonsense, causing the gang members to be fearful of her sometimes. On the other hand, Sayu believes that she will disturb her sleep because \"birds of a feather flock together\"."

I know outsiders don't think very highly of the Arataki Gang, and the members themselves don't really care what others think. But, I still want to strive to change the impression we leave. I might complain about them from time to time as my family, but I'll never let anyone badmouth them.",

I wonder if I should study for a qualification in landscape design?\n\t- Traveler: Why not? Go for it!\n\t- Kuki Shinobu: Wow, I like the enthusiasm, haha. Thanks for the support.\n\t- Kuki Shinobu: I guess I'll give it a shot, then. But could you possibly let me borrow this site before the exam, for me to practice on?\n\t- Kuki Shinobu: In return, let's see... I'll cover all your roasted Lavender Melon costs leading up to the exam.

If you've got any questions, ask away!\n\t- Traveler: What is it that you don't like about shrine maidens?\n\t- Kuki Shinobu: I think you may have misunderstood me...\n\t- Kuki Shinobu: I have nothing against any shrine maiden. It's not even that I detest the profession. Believe me, I know every job comes with its challenges...\n\t- Kuki Shinobu: The simple fact is that being a shrine maiden is just not for me. The reasons are complicated... let me think how to explain it...\n\t- Traveler: Is it to do with your family?\n\t\t- Kuki Shinobu: Hmm... You're gonna think this sounds childish, but yes, you're right. Sometimes, I just can't stand my family...\n\t\t- Kuki Shinobu: I know they only wanted the best for me, but trying to achieve that by planning out every aspect of my life for me just made everything unbearable.\n\t\t- Kuki Shinobu: They always treated me like I was a child, felt like they had to constantly nag me to make sure I didn't slip up. Every time I received a letter of complaint saying that I wasn't warm and friendly enough, they would be on my case about it for days.\n\t\t- Kuki Shinobu: I just don't like to smile, that's all.

I can't bring myself to say \"things'll get better\" to people like that. It's just a cop-out.\n\t- Traveler: That's understandable.\n\t- Kuki Shinobu: In a nutshell, I prefer to work jobs where the metrics are clear and where I can see the actual results of my efforts.\n\t- Kuki Shinobu: Jobs like that come naturally to me, and they give me a chance to show my family that my choices aren't worse than theirs just because they're different.\n\t- Kuki Shinobu: But the most important thing is that I no longer have to force myself to do something I don't want to do.

They aren't mean-spirited, but they do cause no end of trouble.\n\t- Kuki Shinobu: I can't be around them all the time. In the long term, something's gotta change.\n\t- Traveler: You're not going to leave the gang, are you?\n\t\t- Kuki Shinobu: Of course not, at least not for now. As the de-facto manager, I still can't say I've turned the gang into something I'm proud of, and I am not gonna quit halfway.\n\t\t- Kuki Shinobu: Who knows what the future holds, though.\n\t\t- Kuki Shinobu: If it really gets to the point where we end up parting ways, well, sometimes that's just how life goes...\n\t- Traveler: I'll support you whatever you do!\n\t\t- Kuki Shinobu: If you say so, I'll hold you to it.

Despite calling himself a detective and serving the Tenryou Commission, his investigations revolve around his personal principles and appear to be unrelated to any governmental duty. Heizou's view of the term \"detective\" mostly stems from his belief that one should be evil's natural enemy, as the damage had already been done despite any attempt to cover it. This caused him to split with . Despite appearing \"brainy\" to many, Heizou is one of the Tenryou Commission's strongest doushins, being a very skilled martial artist; despite this, he is not very fond of having to fight, as he considers apprehending criminals in that manner blunt.\n\nHis superior, , dislikes him for this but keeps him nonetheless as he always brings back results.

How have you been?\n- Shikanoin Heizou: Remember, if you ever find yourself caught up in some strange case, just notify me immediately.\n- Traveler: How do you like it here?\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe, thanks for looking out for me.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: But no need to worry, I'd say the peace and quiet you have here makes it an even better vacation spot than Watatsumi Island.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Too bad there are no cases to crack, though... It's almost too serene. Lacks a little intrigue.\n\t- Traveler: I'm sorry about that...\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Oh — no no, that's my problem. Gah, look at me, making you feel bad...\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: ...Hey, I have an idea! I think it'll give me a chance to redeem myself and serve as something fun to do.\n\t- Traveler: Is there anything I can do for you?\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Oh? Well, I guess there is one thing.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Let's play a little game of mine!\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Here's how it works: After you return here each day, I'll try to guess what you did that day, what you ate... even who you saw.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: If I win, you'll think of something to do for me. But, if I lose, then I'll treat you to the best Kushikatsu place I know. How's that sound?\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Sure, of course! I've actually been waiting to give you a taste of the old Heizou treatment.\n\t- Traveler: Wait... a taste of what now?\n\t- Traveler: Is that a dressing down... or a beatdown?\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, no no no no, you've got it all wrong. You see, I've been hanging around here for a while now.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: And whether it's from the more obvious details like the style and arrangement of your space, or the more subtle details like the type of decorations you've set out... Just by looking around, I've already gathered a lot of info about you.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: I have deduced that not all the arrangements here is based on your personal taste, no... on the contrary, some of it is intentionally done with visiting friends in mind.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: As for what led me to this conclusion...\n\t- Traveler: Amazing! You really are quite the detective.\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Oh? Using a compliment to change the subject, are we?\n\t- Traveler: I want to gather info about you, too!\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Oh? Trying to change the subject, are we?\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: It appears you have some secrets that you'd prefer to leave unspoken.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: In that case, let me start by telling you about myself. Now, where to begin...\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: You've already heard about who I am and who my connections are. And I'm sure you know my general likes and dislikes after all this time together...\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: As for my family background, I'm guessing you're not too interested in that...\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Ah, how about this! I'll tell you my weakness.\n\t- Traveler: Do you even have a weakness?\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: You betcha. Don't let my usual rational appearance fool you. It turns out that I'm easily swayed by emotion.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: People have this real... glow about them when they're doing something they believe in, you know? They stand out in the world, like Flaming Flowers. And they make it a brighter place.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: That's why I strive to keep those people safe from anyone looking to take advantage. Call me crazy, but when I see something beautiful, I wanna keep it that way.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: By the way, you've got that spark in you too. It's hit me a few times in our time together, I could genuinely feel it.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Shh! That's my weakness, okay? So be sure to keep this one top-secret.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Anything you want to do?\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: I was just about to head out for a bit. Care to join me, my dear partner?\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: But the trip might be a little inconvenient. First, we'll have to go into town and buy a few things we'll need. After that, we'll head out of town for a while, and we'll likely need to return to the Police Station again before the day's through...\n\t- Traveler: Are you going to arrest a criminal?\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Excellent question! But naturally, the answer is no. I'll leave that task of apprehending criminals to colleagues who specialize in that kind of thing.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Actually, I was thinking of visiting the relatives of some convicted criminals. Some of them are elderly folks, some of them are just kids.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: It was my conclusive evidence that landed their relatives in prison. If it wasn't for me, then they wouldn't be left all on their own now...\n\t- Traveler: You shouldn't feel guilty about that...\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, don't worry. I know very well that the criminal is the one who should feel guilty.\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Catching the culprit is what Detective Heizou is all about.\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: But when it comes to regrets... *sigh* I only regret that I couldn't stop the tragedy by nipping the crime in the bud.\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: For now, while the criminals are serving their time at correctional facilities, I'll help look after their families.\n\t- Traveler: Wow, you really care a lot for them...\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Yes. Of course, it's Detective Heizou's duty to establish the truth.\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: But once the case is solved, the criminal's family are the ones who will face public ridicule and discrimination.\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Of course, it's my hope that they can move on from the events of the case sooner rather than later and just continue on with their lives.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: After all, speaking just as plain old Heizou here, I'm a firm believer in helping those in need and being kind to other people.\n\t- Traveler: So you're gonna go pay them a visit with some gifts?\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Oh no, that wouldn't work out well. Tensions tend to rise the moment they see my face. There's a chance they would even start throwing punches at me.\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: You see, my intention is to just show them some care, so it's better not to reopen any old wounds.\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Better if I just leave the items with a letter on their doorstep.\n\t- Traveler: Or were you just gonna leave the stuff on their doorstep?\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe, as my partner, I knew you'd catch on. You're already thinking a step ahead before I've explained anything.\n\t\t- Shikanoin Heizou: With the way we understand each other, it'd be waste of time to elaborate.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Anyway, we'll leave once you're ready.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: My intuition tells me that with you coming along, this will be the smoothest and most enjoyable trip yet.\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Heizou!\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Morning, Traveler! Sleep well? Did you have any dreams? If so, what did you see?\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe... seriously, if you've got a moment, I'd love to hear all the details.\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Goodnight, Heizou.\n\t- Shikanoin Heizou: You look pretty worn out, get some sleep!

            "Personality": "A trainee ranger active in Avidya Forest. Behind her enthusiastic words and actions hides a slightly introverted personality.\n\nWhen Collei first arrives in , she is extremely wary and suspicious of people because of her past experiences, preferring to be left alone and making her seem cold. Her pessimistic view of the world comes from the mistreatment and abuse she endured everywhere. She also has a rather low opinion of herself, pushing people away because she is \"unclean\" and says she is unworthy of their time.\n\nShe was initially annoyed by  because of her cheerful and optimistic personality, but Amber shows her kindness by offering to help her find that something she lost, even insisting they are friends and protecting her from 's intimidation multiple times. The two continue to grow closer during the course of the  and Collei begins to trust Amber, becoming less wary of people as her view of the world becomes brighter.\n\nWhen Amber protected Collei from Barnabas, Collei was touched by Amber's resolve and realizes that she too wishes to be able to protect others. After having her powers sealed by , she decides to leave with him to Sumeru in hopes of learning more about the world.\n\nBy the time she meets the , Collei is shown to have matured whilst training under Tighnari and is now considerably more positive. She expresses great admiration for Amber, whose compassion deeply moved Collei to the degree that it influenced her behavior and hobbies. Inspired by Amber's benevolence, Collei tries to be very helpful and proactive in her  duties and strives to be as friendly as possible to everyone. Although she still has struggles with her literacy and Eleazar, she attempts to discard her past pessimism in favor of pushing forward and doing the best she can regardless.\n\nShe also developed a deep sense of empathy, extending even to the gods, whom she used to deem forsaken by, she now wonders if they too can feel just as helpless. She states that looking back, her extended hatred towards the world outside the Fatui was \"childish.\" She also expresses guilt over her time in Mondstadt and is interested in apologizing.\n\nDespite her improved outlook, it is clear that Collei has yet to fully put her trauma behind her. Whilst no longer being bitter about it, Collei still finds it very difficult to open up to others about her past and avoids the subject when possible, as it brings back painful memories. Her introverted nature also leads her to occasionally spend time alone in a tree hollow, where she writes about any troubles or frustrations she may feel.\n\nCollei is somewhat of a bad liar, only being able to convince Amber on why she wanted to know about the Fatui's research. She is also prone to panic attacks and breakdowns, and especially hates being pushed or shoved around. Even just trying to touch her might cause extreme fear and discomfort, as shown when Paimon tried to playfully touch her the day they met for the first time in Sumeru. This shock apparently triggered a flare-up of her disease, causing her to be bedridden the next day."

I was sure he'd gone and... Ahem, never mind.\n\t- Collei: I learned a few new words recently. I wanted to get the hang of them, so I tried to use them all in my letter.\n\t- Collei: But if that made it too difficult to read, I guess I was getting ahead of myself.\n\t- Collei: I need to take it slowly and use new words more carefully. Better to mix in a few new words with what I already know.\n\t- Traveler: I can spell-check your letters for you.\n\t- Collei: Really? Wow, thanks!

I was thinking maybe we could leave today?\n\t- Traveler: Today!?\n\t- Collei: Um... well actually, I only handed in my exam paper so far.

Here? ...Actually, yeah, I never thought of that!\n\t- Collei: Plenty of open space, a great view, and no danger...\n\t- Traveler: Consider it the trial run before we go camping for real.\n\t- Collei: Alright!

The day's plans are best made at dawn. The early bird catches the worm.\n\t- Tighnari: Early-rising worms might object to this, of course, but that's just how the food chain works.\n\t- Tighnari: See, no matter how early they rise, a tree's leaves will still get eaten by insects. You don't hear them complaining, do you?\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good evening, Tighnari.\n\t- Tighnari: You aren't asleep yet, Traveler?\n\t- Tighnari: If you're still awake at this hour, then how about I borrow you as my research assistant?\n",

Just as she was beginning to feel helpless, she happened to find a magic lamp in her warehouse. She began to polish the lamp, when all of a sudden, a puff of red smoke came out.

So the merchant wished that she could earn more Mora in the future than she could ever hope to count.

                "More About Dori: V": "Hearing the merchant's story, the Fog Div became very puzzled. The div and the genie were obviously of the same species, so how come the div couldn't perform any magic? The merchant praised the Fog Div's potential, saying that it, too, would surely gain the genie's great power if only it were to stay in the same magic lamp. The Fog Div agreed and entered the merchant's magic lamp... Huh? Is this a real story? Backstory details cost extra! Give me another 990,000 Mora and I'll tell you!",

                "More About Candace: II": "We are a people whose god is no longer with us. Lies pose no threat to us... the threat we face is the prospect of no tomorrow. The path before us is paved with barbs, there is pain in every step — yes, we tread forward clinging to a lie, but perhaps... perhaps there is more virtue in this than in selfishly embracing the truth, and death along with it...",
                "More About Candace: III": "Even now, there are those who hold on to a belief that the King Deshret will be resurrected. But it's not possible. The past is but grains of sand, scattered to the four winds. The best we can do is to let go, and leave the wind to carry them to their final resting place.",
                "More About Candace: IV": "My shield? Well, according to what people outside the village say, it has the blessing of . With this shield in hand, all the grains of sand are my eyes and ears, and the desert is ready to do my bidding... Their imaginations can get a little carried away sometimes. But anyway, that aside, the main thing for me is it always works a charm.",

                "Candace's Troubles": "Every now and then, a few violent thugs make the mistake of trying to disrupt the peace and tranquility of Aaru Village. I do wonder... is chasing them into a monster-infested valley perhaps a little too... merciful? What do you think, do you have any better ideas on how they should be dealt with?",
                "Favorite Food": "To me... quantity is more important than taste when it comes to food. Life in the desert uses up more energy than you might think. After a day's work, there's nothing more satisfying than having a filling meal.",
                "Least Favorite Food": "I don't hate it, but compared to regular meat, eating fish is a real nuisance... Maybe it's because we don't really eat fish here in the desert, but for whatever reason, I'm just not very good at removing all those prickly little bones... This must sound ridiculous to you.",

                "Feelings About Ascension: Climax": "I learned to wield the spear and shield knowing that I would one day need them, and today I use these skills to protect the village. So perhaps this new strength I now gain in the present is preparing me for trials that lie ahead in the future.",

It is said that when he gets down to work, the General Mahamatra is even more sufficient than the \"Great Vayuvyastra\" made by the Kshahrewar.\nCyno is a curt, stoic and generally emotionless young man with a ruthlessness and vicious approach to his duty as a matra that make him intimidating and unapproachable. He cares little for niceties or social gatherings and is known throughout Sumeru for his ruthless efficiency at upholding the law.\n\nDespite his young age, Cyno holds the position of General  in the Akademiya and takes his position seriously. Cyno is extremely dedicated to upholding the Akademiya's rules and punishing any transgressions, to such an extent that even the  of the Akademiya (ostensibly his superiors) are wary of him. Notoriously, Cyno will relentlessly pursue any individuals that try to flee his judgment, even across the desert — a trait that, in combination with his prowess as a hunter and warrior, makes escaping from Cyno nigh impossible. Due to this, Cyno's name is infamous within Sumeru and many scholars fear the prospect of ever meeting him, despite the fact that he only handles cases of significant interest.\n\nNotably, Cyno idolizes \"justice\" above all; though this predominantly manifests in his pursuit of suspected criminals, Cyno will also protect criminals from any danger that arises during their escape attempts until they can, in his view, be properly judged by the Akademiya. Although he is often viewed by the Akademiya's scholars as an obstacle or a threat to their research (complaints to which Cyno is indifferent), Cyno views his role as that of a protector, preventing seekers of knowledge from being led astray and becoming dangers to both themselves and the world. However his being blessed with an Electro Vision suggests that his view of justice is closer to a desire to preserve the law, which he holds as eternal, rather than being interested in justice in and of itself.\n\nDespite his seriousness in academics and work-related matters, Cyno is fairly relaxed outside of Akademiya duties, being an avid fan of . He shows concern for , frequently visiting her when he has the time to ensure that she's doing well, as well as harboring friendships with ,  and . Despite his intentions to put people at ease, he maintains his emotionless, harsh attitude in most situations, even outside of work. Aware that his reputation as General Mahamatra often intimidates those around him (even his fellow Matras), Cyno tells jokes as a way to help people relax around him, though his jokes are generally unfunny and his long-winded attempts to explain them even more so.\n\nCyno also confesses to a fondness for the desert from which he hails, finding himself most at ease there and often taking nighttime strolls there to help himself relax."

When the main character found themselves in a rough spot, they somehow drew a card that wasn't even supposed to exist. This shook me to the core, and presented me with a great conundrum: Through directly manipulating the deck, they were able to pull off a miracle that nobody could have expected. The question is... should it be seen as breaking the rules, or is this, too, ultimately within the rules of the game?",

First, I have this deck for you that I worked on for a few days, I think it'll really suit your style. Also, I adjusted my schedule to open up some time, so is there anywhere you'd like to go? I'd be happy to accompany you. A birthday only lasts a day, but you should take the chance to really enjoy it. Just make sure we can be back within three days.",

I just tell myself that I'm on a vacation and that I shouldn't worry about what's going on anywhere else.\n\t- Cyno: Though, of course, before bed every night I still reflect on my previous battles and review what I've learned.\n\t- Traveler: Have you managed to get any rest?\n\t- Cyno: Don't worry, I feel much more relaxed now than I was at the .\n\t- Cyno: The point of rest is to relieve the stress and fatigue you've built up, it doesn't mean completely changing who you are.\n\t- Cyno: I really like it here. It's a place where I can finally enjoy a moment of peace. I'll use this time to revitalize myself and prepare for the next time I need to administer judgment.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Want to have a chat?\n\t- Cyno: Sure, I'll even tell you a couple of jokes.\n\t- Cyno: Why did the  cross the road while burdened with heavy goods? To get to Sumeru's \"Most Sumptuous Sumpter Beast\" bodybuilding competition.\n\t- Cyno: Well, what do you think?\n\t- Traveler: Huh?\n\t- Traveler: Is that all?\n\t- Cyno: Here's another one. Which creature has the worst personal hygiene in all of Teyvat? s. Why? Because they always bounce on top of the water, and never go in for a bath.\n\t- Traveler: ???\n\t- Cyno: You don't find that funny at all?\n\t- Traveler: Uhh... it's very forced...\n\t- Traveler: Maybe a little...\n\t- Cyno: Okay. Well, never mind...\n\t- Cyno: It's really hard for me to tell what jokes someone might find funny.\n\t- Traveler: Why are you so eager to tell jokes?\n\t- Cyno: It's because I always have this ultra-serious look on my face, and it stresses out the other .\n\t- Cyno: One time, it hit me that I should try telling a couple of jokes. So I gave it my best shot, and the room fell completely silent, with everyone just staring at me. But then, after a few moments, someone started laughing and said \"you call that a joke!?\"\n\t- Cyno: Then everyone else started laughing. Even though they were all saying that my jokes weren't funny, I could tell that I had lightened the mood.\n\t- Cyno: So I thought, even if the jokes aren't funny, at least telling them can still help the others around me feel more at ease.\n\t- Cyno: Besides... if I tell lots of jokes, not ALL of them can be bad, surely.\n\t- Cyno: I just need to stick to it, and I know that one of them will land... someday.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?\n\t- Cyno: Now that I think about it, it's been all of five days since I last played a game of .\n\t- Traveler: Does that feel like a long time to you?\n\t- Cyno: No, not really. The longest I've ever gone without playing was 20 days.\n\t- Cyno: I was on a dangerous mission and didn't have any time to sit down and play.\n\t- Cyno: By the time I got back, I realized that my deck was already out of the meta, and I kept losing game after game. Eventually, I made some adjustments and finally started turning things around.\n\t- Cyno: You have to keep playing if you want to maintain a good win rate. Otherwise, you'll be caught off guard by new and upcoming strategies.\n\t- Traveler: You really like Genius Invokation TCG, don't you?\n\t- Cyno: Yes. Is that strange? You have a funny look on your face.\n\t- Cyno: The first time I played, I just saw it as a game to pass the time.\n\t- Cyno: As a matra, your heart is like a bowstring... It cannot become too slack, but it cannot be too taut, either. Otherwise, it could snap without warning at any time.\n\t- Cyno: So once I started playing Genius Invokation TCG, I wanted to use it as a way to take my mind off other things. You know, as a way to help me relax.\n\t- Cyno: ...But now, it is much more than just a game to me.\n\t- Traveler: What changed?\n\t- Traveler: I think I understand what you mean.\n\t- Cyno: In my previous work, I punished many criminals who had broken the rules and had to listen to their constant complaining.\n\t- Cyno: In most cases, I couldn't understand them, and they couldn't seem to understand me, either.\n\t- Cyno: And it's not just criminals. Even with your friends, there are bound to be some topics where you are unable to understand one another.\n\t- Cyno: But Genius Invokation is different. I can always clearly discern what my opponent is thinking.\n\t- Cyno: Their hunger for victory, their confidence in the deck, their passion for the game... Many can hide their strategy, but few can conceal these emotions.\n\t- Traveler: I can relate to those feelings, too.\n\t- Cyno: Really? Are you up for a game then?\n\t- Traveler: Are you kidding? I thought you'd never ask!\n\t- Traveler: Please go easy on me...\n\t- Cyno: I never go easy on anyone. Just play your best.\n\t- Cyno: I'll help walk you through the game once we're finished.\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Cyno.\n\t- Cyno: Good morning, you look like you're ready and raring to go.\n\t- Cyno: Any plans today? If there's anything you need help with, just let me know.\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good night, Cyno.\n\t- Cyno: Sleep well.

Her burden is heavy, but though she may experience loneliness, and though darkness is all she sees before her, she will not stop moving forward.",
            "Personality": "A caged bird secluded within the confines of the Sanctuary of Surasthana who can only see the world in her dreams.\nWhen the Traveler and Paimon first meet Nahida in the Sabzeruz Festival samsara, she was an elusive and secretive individual. She voluntarily left ruling the city to the sages, though like in cases with the samsara, she would intervene as best she could if they stepped out of line. She also suffered from very low self-esteem as a result of the way the sages treated her. However after the downfall of the sages and the cleansing of Irminsul, many of these traits have minimized or vanished. She now openly wanders around the city, when she has time, and interacts with her people and has an overall far more genuinely cheerful view of herself.\n\nDespite her previously difficult circumstances, when she spoke to people she rarely revealed her sadness. She almost always maintains a gentle and kind demeanour when she speaks to others, and treats everyone as equals. However, she admits that her social skills and understanding of human interaction needs work, and she's prone to slightly eccentric speech and behaviour as a result. She also professes a fondness for analogies and frequently makes use of them when attempting to explain things to others. Like many in Sumeru, she believes in helping people come to answers on their own, particularly regarding heavier truths, rather than providing all the answers. As a result she's also prone to peppering her speech with a mixture of analogies and subtle clues about things she wants others to learn.\n\nAs the God of Wisdom, Nahida's most notable traits are her exceptional intelligence, knowledge, and planning. She's capable of creating extremely thorough, multi-layered plans and can even be a little manipulative if the situation calls for it. She's also capable of making plans in a pinch, as shown when she bartered with Dottore. Perhaps most of all, Nahida is skilled at realizing when her intelligence is required and when her kindness is required, or both."

Then, I shake it up, and time how long it takes to settle, and see if there's any difference from the last time. There's no reasoning behind it and nothing to gain out of it, but somehow it seems to relieve the exhaustion in my brain. I think that the fact that it's for nothing is what makes it fun for me.",

Heavily prone to somnambulism and locked in a grinding war with sleep deprivation, the problem of restful slumber is a most troubling one to her.\n\nDue to in part of the Akademiya lifestyle, Layla is highly devoted to her studies, but this has also left her somewhat paranoid and highly sleep deprived, making her very timid and looking like she could collapse from exhaustion at any point. Despite these traits, Layla is unusually perseverant, having outlasted several of her classmates who had joined at the same time as her.\n\nLayla's lack of sleep is to the point that she ends up sleepwalking in the night, where an alternate personality manifests from her. This persona is energetic and determined, helping solve all of her problems (who dubs the present Layla as \"Daytime\") in an instant. When Layla wakes up, she expresses surprise as to how her papers had been completely finished. She appears to be unaware of her alternate persona, instead believing that she's blessed by the stars."

I've walked the walk, so I can promise you that everything you'd learn would be a great boon for your future adventures. There's no reason not to trust me!",
                "About Us: Solving Puzzles": "When I was trapped, I spent so long solving puzzles that I became numb to even the flow of time. Now that I'm free again, I no longer have to face the puzzles of the world all on my own. Maybe we'll be able to spend some fun times together copying inscriptions, deciphering runes, and solving puzzles... Every minute should be savored.",
                "About the": "Hmph. My illustrious resume aside, my intellectual capabilities have been acknowledged even by the  himself. As for why I still can't find any students... Well, it's not due to any faults on my part or that of my Darshan. Maybe it's a matter of timing? I also received my Vision at precisely an opportune moment, after all.",
                "Something to Share:": "Those geezers at Haravatat love to decline my funding requests with the excuse that my research's become too niche and impractical. By that logic, since we're still the Darshan with the lowest enrollment numbers, we might as well close our doors altogether.",
                "Interesting Things": "I've visited numerous ruins of all shapes and sizes and interpreted what scant texts and symbols I could find.  are indeed mechanisms of the highest order. Hmm... perhaps \"mechanism\" isn't the best word for them. You could argue that they're antiquated \"living organisms\" that have managed to survive until the present day...",
                "About": "I remember her; she's a courteous girl. I've only been to the Grand Bazaar a few times, but she's already remembered my name and face, and she's even tried to get the others to stop arguing with me. She really gets it! All youngsters should be more like her.",
                "More About Faruzan: I": "Interested in my story? Well, Madam Faruzan's life started more than a hundred years ago, and her story covers as much ground as some major academic publications. Still curious? Good, willingness to learn is an indispensable trait for scholars. You've got one foot in the door.",
                "More About Faruzan: II": "Solving a truly ancient mechanical puzzle requires deciphering a deluge of ancient texts. I don't mean to boast, but they're probably on a completely different level from the ones you've solved on your adventures. Oh? Don't believe me? Then why don't you pick out some of the hardest ones you've done and show them to me? If I spend more than a half hour on any of them, it's your win.",
                "More About Faruzan: III": "If I didn't accidentally lose myself in that  ruin, I could have contributed even more to Sumeru... Thankfully, my manuscripts and treatises were still put to good use. Those freeloading Kshahrewar used them to establish the fundamentals of the study of mechanisms. Haha, I'm not called \"Madam Faruzan\" for nothing, you know.",
                "More About Faruzan: IV": "As a scholar, I should have the courage to accept failure and shoulder all of its consequences. I never wanted anyone to pity me, whether it be back then or right now. Also, don't forget that I eventually managed to solve that final puzzle by my own power, and freed myself from that accursed place... Instead of pity, shouldn't people feel encouragement and inspiration from my story?",
                "More About Faruzan: V": "My field of study is nowhere as esteemed as it used to be, and Haravatat has refused me funding more than once. Every now and then, Kshahrewar will try to invite me to teach under their banner, and the conditions they've offered me are truly out of this world. More students, a higher spending limit... I still turned them down, however. No matter what, someone has to keep studying niche topics, so we can expand the frontiers of humanity's knowledge.",
                "Faruzan's Hobbies": "Some greedy merchants and mercenaries try to hawk \"antiques\" of unknown origin in  at exorbitant prices, but their goods are nothing more than secondhand trash. Hmph, I bust their scams whenever I catch sight of one. My skill in antiques appraisal is probably second only to the gods of the Seven.",
                "Faruzan's Troubles": "A hundred years ago, my greatest source of frustration was my inability to decipher the information engraved on ruin monuments. Now, nothing irritates me more than the struggle to get funding. Ugh, it's making my head hurt again...",
                "Favorite Food": "You can improve the aroma of batter several times over if you bake it in the oven. Next time we're in the kitchen, I'll make some for you so you can get a taste of the flavors from my time. Since it'll be my super secret ancient recipe, I bet you won't find anything like it in the whole Grand Bazaar.",
                "Least Favorite Food": "There's a new dessert that they call . Who decided to create it? Shouldn't puddings be made with rice? These culinary innovations are really getting out of hand. Thank you, but there's really no need to share it with me, even if you made it yourself.",
                "Receiving a Gift: I": "*munch* This is tastier than the food at most historic establishments. Could it be that the culinary arts haven't stopped improving?",
                "Receiving a Gift: II": "The appearance, smell, and taste of this dish are all excellent. Do you read a lot of professional cooking books?",
                "Receiving a Gift: III": "Hm? This indescribable taste... Are you trying to get me to figure out what this is?",
                "Birthday": "Happy birthday! Here's a small toy for you. It's an assembly of a number of miniature puzzle mechanisms — you can find a button and lever here, as well as a roller to the side. Just play with it however you want, and I'll take care of it if it breaks. Hmph, and don't think I'm treating you like a child. Everyone, regardless of age, could use a moment of happiness and relaxation.",

                "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion": "The past one hundred years have only afforded me the glimpse of a spindrift floating upon the endless sea of wisdom. As for the fields and puzzles that remain to be studied and explored... It'll be up to you and I to reveal their secrets."

I'll give you all the help you need.\n- Faruzan: Of course, if you are in need of some life advice, feel free to consult with me as well.\n- Traveler: How do you like it here?\n\t- Faruzan: I'm quite comfortable. Don't worry, I'm not one of those crabby old geezers who love to find fault with everything... I'm usually quite easy to please...\n\t- Faruzan: Hmm? Don't you believe me?\n\t- Faruzan: Maybe I do nitpick every once in a while... but only with disrespectful students. Or those nonsensical rules at the Akademiya.\n\t- Faruzan: You're very agreeable, and the scenery here is quite lovely, so why wouldn't I like it here?\n\t- Traveler: Glad to hear it.\n\t\t- Faruzan: Haha, one does not run into youngsters as kind and considerate as yourself nowadays.\n\t\t- Faruzan: Let's say, hypothetically, I were to discover some design flaws after staying here for some time... you wouldn't mind if I shared them with you, would you?\n\t\t- Traveler: Sure! No problem.\n\t- Traveler: Do you need anything else?\n\t\t- Faruzan: Hmm... Could you get me some pens and paper?\n\t\t- Faruzan: When I arrived in this realm for the first time, I was very surprised indeed by the unique configuration.\n\t\t- Faruzan: Just what kind of mechanism allows all of this to be ensconced in a single teapot... I need to do some research...\n\t\t- Faruzan: But it wouldn't be polite to leave you with piles of notes everywhere...\n\t\t- Traveler: Sure! No problem.\n\t- Faruzan: Good, good. It seems like I'll be able to research my interests here to my heart's content after all.\n\t- Faruzan: Even if it ends up taking me another hundred years... Hehe, I will be quite content here.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?\n\t- Faruzan: Speaking of \"chatting\"... I once contemplated this concept in quite some depth.\n\t- Faruzan: So here's a question for you: What sets conversation apart from other means of information exchange — such as a debate, or passing on a message?\n\t- Traveler: The goal of \"chatting\" is to get to know somebody?\n\t- Faruzan: Mm-hmm, that's exactly right.\n\t- Faruzan: We want to learn more about the other person's feelings, opinions, and preferences. Plus, conversing also allows us to share interesting experiences, as well as ease each other's burdens.\n\t- Faruzan: The exact topic of the conversation doesn't matter as long as you're learning about the other person.\n\t- Faruzan: Or to put it another way, every topic matters. For those who care about you, even the most trivial things about your life will be worth their full attention.\n\t- Faruzan: Alas. I regret to say in the past, I have never had the time to consider the value of conversation.\n\t- Faruzan: Day after day, I shut myself in and toiled away at my research... Even when I was out traveling in foreign lands, I made sure to keep my letters to friends and family short and to the point. I never shared any bad news, only the good.\n\t- Faruzan: I dare say that I earned the title of a scholar. Yet I cannot call myself a good daughter, student, or friend.\n\t- Traveler: Don't say that, Madam Faruzan...\n\t- Faruzan: Thank you for your concern.\n\t- Faruzan: Whew... But there's no need to fret. You know me, I'm not one to dwell endlessly on the past...\n\t- Faruzan: I say all this only as a reminder to myself:\n\t- Faruzan: It's important to appreciate what you have in the here and now... to value and cherish the people you are close to.\n\t- Traveler: I can't agree more!\n\t- Traveler: Well said, Madam Faruzan!\n\t- Faruzan: Alright, there's no need to flatter me. If you agree with my sentiments, why don't you help me put them into practice?\n\t- Faruzan: As someone I greatly value, you may occasionally find yourself in receipt of a letter from me, or indeed I may approach directly for a face-to-face conversation.\n\t- Faruzan: ...I just hope you won't find me to be excessively chatty.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Anything you want to do?\n\t- Faruzan: Hmm... I'm trying to figure out what the kids from the desert might enjoy. Would they prefer snacks or toys...?\n\t- Faruzan: Do you have some time to help me out?\n\t- Traveler: You're headed to the desert?\n\t- Faruzan: Mm-hmm. A colleague of mine left the Akademiya some time ago to return to the desert as a teacher. I received a missive from her the other day.\n\t- Faruzan: She was wondering if I had any interest in paying her a visit, and perhaps holding a few literacy classes for the students...\n\t- Traveler: That's great! You'll finally have some new students!\n\t- Faruzan: Haha, so you haven't forgotten about my wish.\n\t- Faruzan: But the point of this trip would be to just help them learn to read some of the most commonly used words.\n\t- Faruzan: We want to make reading easier for them so they can hopefully discover more interests on their own.\n\t- Faruzan: If some of the seeds that we plant today can take root and grow into lofty trees in the future, that is enough for me.\n\t- Faruzan: Whether they choose to pursue the same field of research as me is a separate matter... Ultimately, it will all depend on their natural aptitude.\n\t- Traveler: You're hoping that some of them do, right?\n\t\t- Faruzan: Hmph, look at you, trying to figure me out. Do I detect someone is getting a little too big for their boots?\n\t- Traveler: Surely you'll get at least ONE new student from this?\n\t\t- Faruzan: Hmph, look at you, trying to take a dig at me. Do I detect someone is getting a little too big for their boots?\n\t- Faruzan: There's no point in teaching you a different kind of lesson right this moment, though. I still need time to finish some prep...\n\t- Faruzan: Speaking of prep... Ah, drat.\n\t- Traveler: What's wrong?\n\t- Faruzan: It just came back to me. A little while ago, the Akademiya announced a new set of rules for off-site teaching. Every instructor must fill out a whole set of application forms.\n\t- Faruzan: Ugh, what a nuisance.\n\t- Faruzan: Oh well, to the ends of the ruins with that. When they find me out, I'll just say my memory failed me. It's not like they can do anything to me.\n\t- Faruzan: Planning for my visit to the desert is far more important. Why don't you come with me to pick out some gifts? Snacks and toys... Let's get a good selection of both.\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Morning, Madam Faruzan!\n\t- Faruzan: Good morning, Traveler.\n\t- Faruzan: Ah, and suddenly the whole day seems a bit brighter...\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good night, Madam Faruzan.\n\t- Faruzan: Oh?

The lack of a human heart caused him to long for a purpose he lacked and thus willingly accepted his memories back to reclaim his sins to be himself once more.\n\nFollowing the restoration of his memories, the Wanderer still retained all of his traits as Scaramouche, simply stating what he sees in front of him. He is not fond of most of his former co-workers, especially Dottore as a result of his meddling with his life and his lies.

He lives free — free from the searching eyes of ordinary people, anyway.\nAlhaitham is a scholar who is fueled by a desire to understand the underlying principles of the world around him.YouTube: [https://youtu.be/JeOJi3tNIDs Character Teaser - \"Alhaitham: Questions and Silence\"] He greatly values the pursuit of knowledge and dislikes meaningless noise and matters that distract or divert him from his chosen pursuits. To this end, while he is unambitious and enjoys leisure, he will do what he deems necessary to maintain a comfortable life. As a result, he is not fond of being a leader, refusing the position of Grand Sage and when thrust upon the position of Acting Grand Sage, expresses an intent to resign as soon as possible.\n\nAlhaitham focuses greatly on himself at all times. However, he does not do so out of a disregard for others; instead, it is a result of his rationality. For example, he believes that as it is impossible to save everyone, it is important to focus on one's own well-being first. As a result, he frequently squabbles with  due to their contrasting ideals and personalities. Contrary to what his peers think, Alhaitham does not look down upon anyone and tends to give equal weight to everyone, be they human or god. He also places great importance in the value of humanity and has astute insight into human nature. While he does not keep this a secret, he rarely bothers to correct others' unfavorable assumptions unless it would prove more troublesome to allow them to persist."

In the end, he'd salvage what he could by scraping pieces of the flesh off the shell, then mixing it with some milk and calling it porridge. ...I do miss the taste of that porridge sometimes... and I miss that old nut-cracker, too.",
                "Interesting Things": "A lot of people see the Red Vulture as an omen of death and disaster, because it feeds on the carcasses of the dead. But the way it soars high above the desert... I've always seen it as a symbol of the tenacity of life. I wonder what the Great Red Sand looks like from all the way up there.",
                "About": "Ahh, the sleepy girl, yeah, I think I remember her. I ran into her once at an oasis on the outskirts of the desert. She was out with some group from the Akademiya doing astronomical observations, or something. I wasn't really paying attention. ...Huh? Candace... what now? Emissary from the stars? The heck is that all about? Almost sounds like she didn't wake up before getting out of bed.",
                "More About Dehya: I": "I've lived around Eremites my whole life. As a little girl, I had a wooden sword for a toy. Everyone I knew growing up was either a merc or on their way to becoming one, and even the bowls we ate our meals from were carved by mercenary blades... After an upbringing like that, it'd be more surprising if I didn't become a merc when I grew up, right?",

                "More About Dehya: III": "Being a merc is tough. The work itself is one thing, but the worst part is trying to get your client to pay you after you finish the job. The Akademiya's top of my list — they're pretty straightforward. The Adventurers' Guild isn't too bad either. But trading merchants can be a total nightmare. They're always telling me that their funds are tied up, so cash is tight, yadda yadda. \"Just a few more days,\" they say. If cash is so tight, how'd you pay for that big pile of goods on your cart, hmm? Tsk.",
                "More About Dehya: IV": "The Akademiya have taken a kinder view of us since everything that went down. I heard that they even released a ton of new regulations to support the desert folk. Hmph, it'd take me till the end of time to read and understand all that documentation... I just hope from now on, the Wall of Samiel will only mark the place where sandstorms end, rather than my folks' hopes and dreams.",
                "More About Dehya: V": "Most mercs are looking to make their fortune and leave their mark. They take on the hardest jobs they can find, hoping to earn as much Mora and prestige as possible. Some are lucky enough to survive and become legends, while others disappear into the desert before anyone's learned their name. I don't have any grand aspirations though. I just want to keep the people I care about safe, so they can live their lives in peace. Of course, I won't complain if I can make some extra Mora along the way, haha.",

Hey, do you know about the siltwater lakes in the desert?\n\t- Traveler: Are they like the ones at Sobek Oasis?\n\t- Dehya: Uh, not exactly.\n\t- Dehya: Siltwater lakes usually appear farther inside the desert. According to some very tall tales, they're believed to be Al-Ahmar's blessings.\n\t- Dehya: Legend has it that when his followers got lost in the desert, Al-Ahmar would command the underground rivers to rise to the surface, forming lakes for the trapped to quench their thirst...\n\t- Dehya: But it's just an urban legend.\n\t- Dehya: The water in siltwater lakes does originate from groundwater, but it's too bitter to be used for drinking.\n\t- Dehya: Besides, these lakes only exist for a short time before they're buried by sand, so you can't use them as landmarks.\n\t- Traveler: So do they have any purpose?\n\t- Traveler: Other than being treated as tourist attractions...\n\t- Dehya: I heard that the Adventurers' Guild did once receive a commission related to siltwater lakes.\n\t- Dehya: As for what the commission was about... I guess some outlanders who were visiting Sumeru wanted to visit the desert and see these lakes for themselves.\n\t- Dehya: So, they hired a group of experienced Guild adventurers to escort them through the desert.\n\t- Dehya: After that...

Hehe!\n- Traveler: Do you like it here?\n\t- Mika: Yes, I love it!\n\t- Mika: This place is amazing, beautiful, and peaceful... There's so many wonderful things I've never seen before.\n\t- Mika: I doubt there's any other place in Teyvat that can compare to this.\n\t- Mika: Even if you just give me a tiny tent, I'll still be super comfortable here.\n\t- Mika: Oh, but... if I'm gonna be camping outside, I'll have to trouble you for some firewood to make a campfire...\n\t- Traveler: No need for that — it's temperate here year-round!\n\t- Traveler: Of course I'd get you what you need!\n\t- Mika: Th—Thank you... I hope me being here isn't too much of an imposition...\n\t- Mika: Um... If there's anything I can help with around here, please do let me know!\n\t- Mika: I used to spend a lot of time cleaning and tidying the house and yard. That was a while ago, but I'm probably still okay at it...\n\t- Traveler: You're my guest, Mika.\n\t- Traveler: All a guest needs to do is make themselves at home.\n\t- Mika: Aw... That's extremely kind of you... Thank you ever so much!\n\t- Mika: Uh, I guess I should stop with all the formalities before I ruin the mood...\n\t- Mika: Alright, I'll make myself at home, then. I want to do a detailed survey of this place... I'll do my best to understand your design philosophy!\n\t- Mika: That way, I can help you out if you ever need it.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?\n\t- Mika: Of course!\n\t- Mika: It's rare to have time alone with you... I have so many things I want to ask you about.\n\t- Mika: For instance, your mastery of the sword allows you to defeat strong opponents that are even beyond the reach of arrows.\n\t- Mika: Distance and firing range are never a problem to you... How do you manage it?\n\t- Traveler: I can show you on the field someday.\n\t- Traveler: But for now, I want to hear your stories.\n\t- Mika: Okay, sure... Since we'll be traveling together, watching you fight will definitely be the best way for me to learn.\n\t- Mika: Um, anyway, let's move on to a lighter topic... What kind of story do you want to hear?\n\t- Traveler: Anything you'd like to share.\n\t- Mika: Um... Let me think... Ah, here's an interesting one about the Reconnaissance Company.\n\t- Mika: When I first started, we'd pluck the petals off a Sweet Flower to decide who was on cooking duty after work.\n\t- Mika: Some of us weren't that good at cooking, but no one ever complained. We'd just polish off everything and then give constructive criticism.\n\t- Mika: With everyone's feedback and a period of trial and error, everyone's culinary skills significantly improved.\n\t- Mika: Obviously, our cooking can't compare to what you'd find at restaurants in the city, but they're pretty delicious as field rations go.\n\t- Traveler: Why don't we try that method as well?\n\t- Traveler: It would be an interesting way to choose the chef of the day.\n\t- Mika: Good idea! It introduces an element of surprise, too...\n\t- Mika: Hehe, I'm already looking forward to our next meal... I'll go and collect some Sweet Flowers!\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?\n\t- Mika: Mmm... Let me think...\n\t- Mika: When the finch adeptus invited me over for some tea, she told me that you can use your willpower to change the topography here.\n\t- Mika: If you don't mind... could you find an open place and form one or two mountains there?\n\t- Mika: It doesn't matter what they look like — as long as it's something that you'd find difficult to climb. The craggier, the better.\n\t- Mika: But if that would take too much time and effort, just scrap the idea...\n\t- Traveler: You mean... you want to go on a hike?\n\t- Mika: Yes! I'm so grateful for the delicious food and the cozy accommodation you've provided, but I fear that I'll get out of shape if I'm too comfortable for too long...\n\t- Mika: I still have a long way to go before I can become a well-seasoned surveyor. I can't get complacent.\n\t- Mika: Besides, understanding the landforms you create will allow me to see what kind of terrain might pose a challenge to you, so I can prepare a plan accordingly.\n\t- Mika: This way, I'll soon be of some help!\n\t- Traveler: I'll give it a go when the time comes.\n\t- Traveler: Let's challenge the most perilous of terrain together!\n\t- Mika: Great! Thank you.\n\t- Mika: Hearing that makes me really motivated!\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Mika.\n\t- Mika: Good morning, Traveler!\n\t- Mika: Have you had breakfast?

            "quote": "The owner of Bubu Pharmacy, the finest pharmacy in all of Liyue. He is rarely seen without a white snake named Changsheng coiled around his shoulders. His prescriptions are varied and diverse, and his medical prowess and compassion are known throughout Teyvat.",
            "Personality": "The owner of Bubu Pharmacy, who is rarely seen without the white snake named Changsheng. His medicinal knowledge is encyclopedic, and his personal intrigues subtle.\nMany rumors  about Baizhu, though most of them are currently unknown — the only one the player ever hears about is that his traditional herbal medicines are extremely bitter. Despite the poor taste of his medicine, most Liyue citizens have complete faith in his medical skills, such as , who considers him the right person to visit when someone cannot identify their symptoms and , who is grateful for his highly effective voice preserving medicines. One of his patients, a sickly young girl named , dislikes his medicine greatly and only agrees to visit Bubu Pharmacy because Baizhu is so kind to her, reasoning that just seeing him would make her feel better. She also believes he is very clever. Baizhu's reputation is so great that even the isolated   is aware of him, and his employee  takes great care in his work to avoid sullying the good name of Dr. Baizhu and Bubu Pharmacy. Despite his great medical skill, Baizhu is not regarded as \"a man of high caliber or great courage.\"\n\nAfter meeting her by chance in the hills, Baizhu took Qiqi in, despite her being a zombie with memory so poor she could barely sort herbs or remember his face. His acceptance of Qiqi was tied to his own personal pursuits, and Baizhu has grown increasingly more relentless in his pursuit of eternal life since meeting her. However, it is later revealed that Baizhu sought immortality in order to protect both himself and Changsheng, aware that those who made contracts with her would eventually die young and he does not want to have others suffer the same fate as them, while not wanting her to die either. Despite having some ulterior motives in taking her in, he is able to make Qiqi cancel orders she has given herself by embracing her and speaking words such as \"I love you the most.\" However, the effect is greatly diminished because Baizhu speaks these words very lightly. At the same time, he quickly acquiesces to whatever she may request from him with no worry at all and affectionately refers to her as \"my little Qiqi.\" Qiqi, who is well aware of his intentions, does not mind staying with him because of his concern.\n\nFurthermore, he is very protective of Qiqi. , though interested in Qiqi's story, finds it is impossible to have a conversation with her whenever Baizhu is around. Baizhu has also repeatedly intervened in 's attempts to lay Qiqi to rest; something that Qiqi dreads and fears. Even after Hu Tao gave Qiqi an exception, she still holds a grudge towards Baizhu for his desire to live longer.\n\nDespite the genuine efficacy of his medical practices, his business practices tend to be shady.  remarks he is pleased to have found new people to fleece after the sale of Everlasting Incense to the Traveler and Zhongli, although Baizhu does not appear to mind her warnings. Despite Changsheng's suggestions of Baizhu's own questionable conduct, he has also had dealings with the legal advisor  about charlatans selling ineffective remedies. To , his sly attitude during their first two meetings seemed strange, yet Yanfei brushed off her concerns and claimed that Baizhu has always acted that way."

However, although the ancient prescriptions were compiled by our ancestors and have stood the test of time, we mustn't also forget to look forward. Times have changed, and so have our surroundings and customs. Treatments that were effective in the bygone times may not prove to be as effective now. Clinging to the classic prescriptions of the past may not ultimately serve the best interest of the patients nowadays.",
                "About Baizhu: Bolstering Hope": "People who suffer from chronic illnesses are often mentally exhausted, and if their condition becomes critical, they may find themselves clinging to life with only a final, thin thread of hope. At such a moment, healing their body is not the priority; the doctor should focus on bolstering their faith in themselves. After all, if the patient believes they aren't going to make it and gives up on themselves, then no medical treatment will be able to help them, no matter how sophisticated the treatment may be.",

                "About Us: Medicine Testing": "A poison to one may be a boon to another. What may be considered to be a universally harmful substance to one group of people may prove to be the perfect medicine needed to save another room of patients. The mechanism behind this is easily understood by those well-versed in pharmacology. It's just that I can't ever tell my patients these kinds of details. If they were to find out that I gave them a poisonous substance as a prescription, it might scare them away for good. Hehe, you're the first person who's never flinched at hearing this. You are the wise Traveler after all — I'm sure you've seen a lot on your adventures. So, ahem, I suppose you'll be fine with more... potent prescriptions in the future, then? I've been worried about finding people to test my medicine on, hehe.",

I've been routinely taking medicine for some years now. All I can really do is eat some candied fruit afterward to get rid of the bitter aftertaste.",
                "Something to Share: Secret Medication": "I've met some people who jump to conclusions and believe they've contracted some deadly disease the moment they experience even the slightest discomfort. Reasoning with them is useless. Eventually, I came up with some tasteless pills made of  and , and prescribed them to these patients. After they calmed down and their \"symptoms\" subsided, they praised the effectiveness of my secret medication. But I suppose I can't fault them for prioritizing their health.",
                "Interesting Things": "It's said that there are a wide variety of mushroom species native to 's rainforests, and that some species can even cause hallucinatory effects, which may have medicinal value.

                "About Hu Tao: Exhausting Encounters": "Baizhu: If possible, I sincerely wish that Director Hu would be more sensible about her business practices. Changsheng: Oh, so you haven't forgotten about the time when she was disseminating flyers right outside of Bubu Pharmacy. Baizhu: *sigh* I just wish that she wouldn't be so concerned about Qiqi whenever she has nothing better to do. Changsheng: Sounds like you have something against her... Baizhu: It's not that I take issue with Director Hu... It's just that every time she kidnaps Qiqi, I have to go all the way to the  to get someone to sort it all out. It's... quite exhausting.",
                "More {sic|about} Baizhu: I": "I am merely a mortal doctor, so I'm afraid I don't have many interesting stories to share. If you're looking for legends, then you should go to the  and listen to the storytellers there.",
                "More about Baizhu: II": "If you're looking for some kind of thrilling story, I'm afraid I don't have one. Even when I was studying medicine under my late Master, I didn't experience any particularly dire situations. My master saw that I had a good head on my shoulders, had me swear a simple oath, and took me in... That's all there was to it.",
                "More about Baizhu: III": "The oath wasn't complicated. I still remember some of it: \"...When a person comes seeking medical attention, I will not consider his status, nor will I be suspicious of or worry about any subsequent consequences. I shall strive to witness the patient's distress and feel it as if were my own, for this is the hallmark of a great physician.\"",
                "More about Baizhu: IV": "I understand my master's intentions. He hoped that I would be able to put myself more in the patients' shoes, and not ever be swayed by external factors. *sigh* He really did have a compassionate heart, and was always ready to sacrifice himself for others. It's unfortunate that he passed so early and never had the chance to live his years to their fullest.",
                "More about Baizhu: V": "While it is a doctor's duty to save others, the doctor is also themselves a person who deserves to be saved. If we wish to preserve lives, we should strive for an outcome where everyone will live to see another day. Those who willingly give themselves up for others are worthy of our respect, but we should not accept their sacrifice as predestined or an inevitable part of life.",
                "Baizhu's Hobbies": "I enjoy sorting medicinal ingredients and using each ingredient's unique properties to produce pills or ointments. I know this process like the back of my hand. People think that the process of making medicine is difficult and complicated, but to me, it brings endless enjoyment. Amazing, isn't it? That we can condense the bounties of heaven and earth into a tiny, unremarkable pill, and use it to bring people back from the verge of death.",
                "Baizhu's Troubles": "The most difficult part of seeing patients isn't prescribing medication, but identifying the cause of the disease. *sigh* There could be a million reasons why someone may feel unwell. Maybe they were having a friendly -eating contest with someone, and ended up damaging their stomach without realizing it. Or maybe, circumstances led them to drink too much water, which caused them to start feeling nauseous. I just wish people would take better care of themselves, and find something better to do than repeatedly put their bodies through so much distress.",
                "Favorite Food": "You shouldn't be a picky eater. Meat, eggs, milk, vegetables, fruit... they all have nutritional value and should be a regular part of your diet, but you should also avoid eating too much. Eating or drinking excessively can also be detrimental to your health. Take it from me. As a doctor, I know all too well that many health crises find their way into the body from the mouth.",
                "Least Favorite Food": "Why would you ever purchase so much candy? *sigh* Just be sure not to eat it too quickly, and remember that too much candy can give you cavities. Me? I seldom indulge in sweets, and I don't often eat spicy food, either. After all, if I don't watch what I eat, then how can I expect that of my patients?",
                "Receiving a Gift: I": "Changsheng: Superb! More please! Baizhu: It is good, isn't it?",
                "Receiving a Gift: II": "Well done. You culinary skills have improved.",
                "Receiving a Gift: III": "Well, at least it still tastes better than medicine.",
                "Birthday": "Changsheng: Sss. Refresh my memory, Baizhu. How do we say that again...? Baizhu: Hehe. You mean how to wish someone a happy birthday? Changsheng: Yes, precisely! Baizhu: I hope that this day will be one filled with joy every year, and that you would always keep these times near. Happy Birthday, Traveler! Changsheng: Hey, so what should I say now? Let me think... Um, uh... *sigh* I can't think of anything. I sincerely wish you a happy birthday, too. Changsheng: What are you laughing at?

Yes, you indeed possess a most intriguing character.\n- Traveler: How do you like it here?\n\t- Baizhu: My way of living differs slightly from those of others, but please don't worry about it.\n\t- Baizhu: I've brought everything that's important to me. After all, it's a doctor's responsibility to take care of themselves first and foremost.\n\t- Traveler: What kind of items?\n\t- Baizhu: Ah, just a few things for my personal use. I'm not in the best physical condition, and have to take my medicine as soon as something begins to flare up. That's why I carry a medicine box wherever I go.\n\t- Baizhu: Apart from the medicine, there are also quite a few bottles and jars in my possession. They're heavy and take up a lot of space, so I didn't bring too many of them along.\n\t- Traveler: Feel free to bring anything you want.\n\t- Traveler: I have more than enough space to spare.\n\t- Baizhu: Thank you, but there really is... a lot.\n\t- Baizhu: You're the owner of this place, and I don't want to take excessive advantage of your hospitality.\n\t- Changsheng: Ugh, look at him, mincing his words and trying to be polite. Let me explain.\n\t- Changsheng: If you ask me, \"a lot\" is a grave understatement. You wouldn't believe how many of those jars there are.\n\t- Changsheng: It'd probably take more than one empty room for everything to fit. Think twice before you say yes!\n\t- Traveler: I–It's fine.\n\t- Baizhu: Hmm... Let me write up a list then. I'll ask Gui to bring them over.\n\t- Changsheng: You seriously think he'll be able to carry everything on his own? Even if he got Qiqi to help, it'd still be impossible to bring them all in one go.\n\t- Baizhu: Perhaps I should take a trip back to the pharmacy to pack everything up, and have them delivered a few boxes at a time...\n\t- Traveler: Just how much stuff do you have?\n\t- Baizhu: Sorry. I'm a bit of a hassle to deal with...\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?\n\t- Baizhu: What topics might you be interested in? I don't want to bore you with abstruse pharmacology, and you probably don't need to listen to my suggestions on healthy living.\n\t- Changsheng: Weren't you rambling about your bottles and jars? I think they're good conversation material.\n\t- Traveler: Bottles and jars?\n\t- Baizhu: That's right. Apart from herbal decoctions, I sometimes also prescribe topical medications for my patients.\n\t- Baizhu: Topical medication often comes in the form of ointments and tinctures. The ingredients are complex and require a precise mixing ratio, so making them is a rather complicated process.\n\t- Baizhu: Of course, I wouldn't expect my patients to be experts in medicine, so I usually make everything myself.\n\t- Baizhu: The pre-processed ingredients essential for making the medicine are all soaked inside the jars.\n\t- Changsheng: Yesss. There is lots of excellent stuff in there.\n\t- Traveler: Such as?\n\t- Baizhu: Mostly just herbs. Some contain potent toxins that must be processed before they can be used.\n\t- Baizhu: While we're on the subject, I have to remind you that to some degree, all medicines have detrimental side effects on the body.\n\t- Baizhu: The issue is not limited to a few specific ingredients — even the mildest medicines have the potential to do more harm than good if they're not used with caution.\n\t- Baizhu: You should refrain from taking medicine unless it's absolutely necessary. Mild discomfort often resolves itself with time.\n\t- Baizhu: So if you ever feel unwell, you should check in with me before taking anything.\n\t- Traveler: Understood, Dr. Baizhu.\n\t- Baizhu: It always pays to be cautious. I had to tell you this even at the risk of sounding insufferable.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Anything you want to do?\n\t- Baizhu: Anything I want to do? The human lifespan is limited to no more than a century, and we often find ourselves with endless desires and insufficient time.\n\t- Baizhu: But we don't have to start being all deep and existential in a casual conversation... There's actually something I'm planning to do.\n\t- Baizhu: Liyue Harbor is a large place. Sometimes, people get severely injured and become incapacitated, while others may land themselves in situations where it's difficult for them to ask for help.\n\t- Baizhu: In either case, it is often well past the golden hour for treatment when the doctor finally arrives at the scene.\n\t- Baizhu: People often wish for doctors to become more efficient, but I'm not able to teleport between places, and as a result, the best window for treatment is often missed.\n\t- Baizhu: In situations like this, the patient should first try to help themselves.\n\t- Baizhu: There are many ways to render self aid before help arrives, but not everyone is aware of them.\n\t- Baizhu: As a doctor, that's something within my power to change — I'm thinking of coming up with some ways to teach people basic first aid.\n\t- Traveler: I think that's a great cause.\n\t\t- Baizhu: Being a doctor comes with great responsibility, so I'm just trying to do my duty.\n\t- Traveler: Can I help in any way?\n\t\t- Baizhu: I've drafted a preliminary plan, but I still need to go over a few details to make the whole process more efficient.\n\t- Baizhu: Having someone listen to me while I think aloud at length is already a great help.\n\t- Baizhu: I'll make sure to go over the details with you once I've put together a better plan.\n\t- Baizhu: I might need your help again when the time comes.\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Baizhu.\n\t- Baizhu: Good morning, Traveler.\n\t- Baizhu: The fresh and crisp morning air works wonders for lifting one's spirits.

I'm gonna snooze a while longer.\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good night, Baizhu.\n\t- Baizhu: Good night, Traveler.\n\t- Baizhu: It's important to follow the body's natural rhythm and rest when the sun is down. Staying up at night and napping throughout the day may sound tempting, but it's detrimental to your health.\n\t- Baizhu: Ahem, my apologies, I wasn't trying to call you out or anything.

He is an aesthete troubled by reality.\nKaveh is a well-known Sumeru architect who is graduated from  with honors. He is a staunch defender of the arts and greatly appreciates aesthetics and artistic maturity in most things including architecture, interior designs, mechanics, and even storytelling. In contrast to 's rationality, Kaveh operates by what he feels to be right, first and foremost.\n\nKaveh has quite the reputation among Akademiya students and Sumeru citizens and is described as a genius and talented architect. For example, , an  located in , admires his masterpiece and feels unfortunate for not having an honor to speak with him in person. , an NPC found in front of the Pharos Lighthouse, and  also praise his magnum opus. Kaveh is characterized by  as a good kid with great potential and original ideas in his mind and  as being unique among  scholars in regards to being more open-minded. Alhaitham describes him as a light of the Kshahrewar and a master builder and craftsman. According to Alhaitham's Character Story, Alhaitham acknowledges Kaveh's exceptional brilliance and portrays him as a genius and an excellent mirror of himself. He also concludes that he possesses a personality and values that are not congruous with his abilities.\n\nKaveh seems to be thoughtful of others and shows great empathy towards people around him. He approaches people without hesitation if he suspects they're in trouble and even lends his hand by providing his Mora. It is mentioned by Alhaitham that he is too considerate of others and is emotionally fragile.Although Alhaitham's English voice-lines say Kaveh tends to be overly sensitive about everyone, the definition of sensitive in here is more close to \"displaying a quick and delicate appreciation of others' feelings\" rather than \"getting easily offended, or upset\" as in original Chinese voice-lines describe him as being too considerate or thoughtful of others. Alhaitham even recounts a story where Kaveh purchased a dozens of handmade keychains that were being sold under the pretense that the proceeds would help feed hungry children. Kaveh states helping others make him happy and thinks mutual assistance, fairness, and righteous anger are also what drive the world. He also seems to be very passionate about his career and works his fingers to the bone to please his clients.\n\nDue to stark contrast in ideologies and personalities, Kaveh gets easily flustered when particularly dealing with Alhaitham. Kaveh and Alhaitham's clash in intense disagreements are shown in the game scenes, character's voice-lines, and even in the messages on bulletin boards across  and . He is also notably unable to tolerate alcohol, easily becoming drunk in a few glasses."

He knows perfectly well how to appear friendly and likable to others, he just doesn't want to. If he ever gives you the impression that he {sic|doens't} really have a temper, or that he's rigidly logical like a machine, then you just don't know him well enough yet.

I—It's okay, I'll chalk it up to you having a unique sense of style.\n\t- Traveler: I arranged them using the insights I've gained on my journey.\n\t\t- Kaveh: Ah, I see. Taking what you've learned from your travels and applying them to your principles of design... Excellent!\n\t\t- Kaveh: You have the eye for this kind of work. If the life of an architect wasn't so difficult, I'd recommend that you enroll in formal study.\n\t- Traveler: I didn't feel like the Palace of Alcazarzaray was all that impressive...\n\t\t- Kaveh: What did you say!?\n\t\t- Kaveh: I... Ahem! It's fine, it's fine, people have different tastes... I can't force you to like my style. Besides, some aspects of it are difficult to appreciate unless you have a certain level of understanding about aesthetics...\n\t\t- Kaveh: Hmph! I'm not so easily offended. Pfft.\n\t- Traveler: But... there's literally nothing here.\n\t\t- Kaveh: ...\n\t\t- Kaveh: ...\n\t\t- Kaveh: Look, I've been pretending that you know something about decorating, so can't you play along, too?\n\t\t- Kaveh: I'm an architect! I build and design things! Seeing your home devoid of anything makes me feel really... really sad.\n\t\t- Kaveh: Can't you try, just a little? Don't let such a wondrous space go to waste.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?\n\t- Kaveh: Sure. Anything you want to talk about?\n\t- Kaveh: It's probably best if I don't pick the topic of conversation. I've had people tell me that I just end up rambling on endlessly about my profession.\n\t- Traveler: Tell me about your life, then.\n\t\t- Kaveh: My life? Hmm... There's a lot I could talk about, but I don't know where to start...\n\t\t- Kaveh: I guess I'll share this... There was once a time in my life when I lived in abject poverty. Bankruptcy led to many a misfortune — in this world, if you don't have money, you essentially have no dignity.\n\t\t- Kaveh: I hated living like that, but I also had no quick way out of that situation. Every day was a struggle between my ego and my reality.\n\t\t- Kaveh: I had a lot of pride about being a master architect, so I detested the idea of doing anything else for a living... Only later did I learn about the more difficult aspects of life.\n\t\t- Kaveh: I was far more idealistic during my years as a student. I hate to admit it, but... an overly naive person cannot survive in this world.\n\t\t- Kaveh: Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to take the conversation to such a heavy place. Please pretend I didn't say anything.\n\t- Traveler: Tell me about what you like.\n\t\t- Kaveh: Hm, things I like... I recently bought a new coffee grinder. It's been great.\n\t\t- Kaveh: It's so elaborately made, and, most importantly, each component is perfectly in its place.\n\t\t- Kaveh: It doesn't have any extra screws or parts, and it grinds beans quickly and silently. It was a great purchase.\n\t\t- Kaveh: Ah, I left the house in a hurry today, so I didn't bring anything with me... I'll bring you some finely ground coffee next time.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Anything you want to do?\n\t- Kaveh: I want to go to the most distant point from here. With such a fantastical realm, I want to know where its boundaries roughly lie.\n\t- Kaveh: It's not every day you come across technology like this. If it could be replicated one day for architectural projects...\n\t- Kaveh: Sumeru's buildings can be divided into several primary categories. Buildings in the rainforest are mostly wooden, while those in Sumeru City and Port Ormos are generally made of stone.\n\t- Kaveh: You've been to Port Ormos, right? Its lighthouse is a paradigm of Sumeru's architecture. I was responsible for its last round of renovations.\n\t- Kaveh: Although we managed to renovate the building's weathered exterior, restoring the lighthouse's heavily eroded foundation was a massive struggle... There was only so much we could do.\n\t- Kaveh: If only we had a place with a stable foundation and an unobstructed view... We could then experiment with builds to improve the lighthouse's structure.\n\t- Traveler: It sounds like you need this teapot much more than I do.\n\t- Kaveh: In some ways, yes.\n\t- Kaveh: But I'd never try to buy this place from you, even if I had the Mora to do so. This little magical teapot must have a special place in your heart.\n\t- Traveler: You could say it's my \"home.\"\n\t- Kaveh: \"Home,\" huh...\n\t- Kaveh: I've designed many houses for others, but a house isn't really the same thing as a home.\n\t- Kaveh: A house can simply be a pile of wood on a plot of land, but a home cannot exist without inhabitants — the presence of people is what turns a house into a home.\n\t- Kaveh: I heard that you embarked on your journey to reunite with your sibling. While I can't completely relate to your situation, the yearning for loved ones is a universal feeling.\n\t- Kaveh: I pray that your dream soon comes true — that you find your  and have  in your life again.\n\t- Traveler: Thank you, Kaveh. Can we commission you when that time comes?\n\t- Kaveh: Hahaha, of course! When that day does come, I won't charge you any commission fees. I'm sure your happiness alone will be more than enough for me.\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Kaveh.\n\t- Kaveh: Good morning. A new day brings new tasks and responsibilities.\n\t- Kaveh: A little tip: Take your time — everything will get done.\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good night, Kaveh.\n\t- Kaveh: You've worked hard. Take some well-deserved rest.\n\t- Kaveh: Cast your troubles to the wayside, and let yourself fall into the sweet embrace of sleep. You might see things in a new light once you wake up.\n",

                "Amidst Scents and Serenity": "- Kaveh: This style is one of the most widely used in Sumeru. You can see its influence on many of the Akademiya's buildings.\n- Kaveh: If I could recommend only one of Sumeru's architecture styles, this one would be it. The central, white section really brings the whole composition together.\n- Kaveh: As for any shortcomings... I suppose the sections extending from the floral vault are prone to collecting dust? It must be a pain to clean them.\n",
                "Of Twirling Dances Unfettered": "- Kaveh: Oh, I just love theaters.\n- Kaveh: They take you away you from your troubles, and you just feel so free...\n- Kaveh: I quite like this fountain. It's on the smaller side, but it serves its purpose well. The decorations on the side are quite lovely, too.\n"

                "About Kirara: Name": "Granny named me Kirara. Back when I still had only one tail, Granny would give me head pats and chin scratches and tell me how bright and pretty my eyes were.",

Not even successful package deliveries can compare with the satisfaction I get from hunting down prey!",
                "Something to Share: Box": "Granny told me that this was my favorite box to sleep in when I was little. Hehe, it's kinda funny — back then, all I knew about Komaniya Express was that their boxes were big and comfy, and if you'd told me that one day, I'd make a living out of giving all their boxes away to other people, I'd have never believed you. Hehe, although it is definitely more of a squeeze trying to fit inside their boxes these days... What? What do you mean, all the stuff in there already...? Ugh, no, I mean their empty boxes!

And there were countless smaller rooms in each of them. Wouldn't living in such a huge place make you feel a little empty inside, though? Having a place to eat in the morning, a place to sunbathe at noon, and a little box to rest in at night is more than enough for me. Huh. Does that mean big houses are just larger boxes for humans?",
                "About": "She's really nice to me. I often ran into her in the past when she was out researching ways to make fabrics and develop color palettes. She was always worried that I'd leave claw marks all over her beautiful textiles, but come on, why would I do that to her? She's running a store in Fontaine now and sometimes asks me to deliver stuff to her. Hehe, she even helped me tailor the clothes I'm wearing now.",

Sometimes a breeze will pick up and the petals will float like  from one end of the street to the other. And when the sun begins to set, I'll find a nice spot to watch the city lights come on. From high up above, they look like flickering specks of sunlight dancing beneath the forest shade at noon. I could stay up there all day if I wasn't in a hurry to deliver my packages... *sigh* I wish I could take Granny with me and show her all these things.",

In the last few days of a long-distance trip, or on a night when all my {sic|work’s} done, I'll always have a hearty meal at the busiest restaurant, then look for the most comfortable rooftop and feel the breeze on my face until I fall sound asleep... There are so many little joys in the world that deserve to be savored, and it'd be such a great loss if I didn't relish every one of them. Which is why I always pick the bones clean when I'm eating fish!",
                "Kirara's Hobbies": "I like delivering packages across the world. Whenever I see an address I've never been to before, I get so excited that I can't sleep. I mean, I just wish that I could be there right this instant. I grew up surrounded by forests and shrubs, and it gets boring pretty quickly. But things are different out here. There are so many things I've never seen before, and it feels like there's something new waiting for me around every corner!",

Humans can't sleep on a roof, catch fish from a pond, or find a nice place to scratch and sharpen their claws... But as soon as I revert to my original form, no one bats an eye over any of these things. The trouble is that my nekomata form attracts a lot of attention, so I can't just walk into a restaurant and order food the way a human would...",
                "Favorite Food": "When I was still a cat, I loved everything Granny made for me — I could gobble up an entire bowl in one go! As for now... Sashimi Platters are my go-to staple! With tender and fresh fish directly served on a plate, I don't even have to go through the hassle of removing the bones and scales! But the restaurant staff always gives me this strange look whenever I start working my way through the fish heads...",
                "Least Favorite Food": "Once, I was catching fish by the ocean when a crab caught me off guard and pinched my tails from behind. It hurt so bad, I thought they were gonna get snipped off! Ugh, why do people like eating crab anyway? They have so little meat, and their shells are so unbelievably thick — I can't even open them with my claws. Oh, and I can't stand anything hot either.

If you want, I can take you to the place I grew up in. It's not bustling with people, and it's not all that interesting, but it always makes me feel relaxed.

I told them though that I'd still prefer more paid-for international vacations, uh, I mean, opportunities to deliver international packages.\n\t\t- Traveler: You sound really passionate about your work.\n\t- Kirara: Why wouldn't I be?

Alright then, allow me to explain the situation from the beginning.\n\t- Kirara: As you're already aware, even though I am a youkai, I've been looked after by my human Granny since a very early age.\n\t- Kirara: It goes without saying that I've heard way more stories about humans than I did about the youkai. I've always looked forward to joining the colorful and warm world that is human society!\n\t- Kirara: But even after I managed to use my youkai powers to give myself a human form, I still didn't know how to fit in. It would be a bit awkward for me to still dress and act like a nekomata when I'd already changed my look...\n\t- Kirara: I began to observe human girls to see what they liked to wear. It seemed to me that everyone really liked bows and flowers...\n\t- Kirara: And so, I added a ton on my own clothes!\n\t- Traveler: They look really cute on you!\n\t\t- Kirara: You really think so? Aw, thanks! *purr*\n\t- Traveler: You could add a few more accessories to match with your outfit.\n\t\t- Kirara: Whoa! A fashion connoisseur? I knew I came to the right person!\n\t- Kirara: So um... would you be willing to accompany me to go on a little shopping spree whenever you're free?\n\t- Kirara: I'd love to buy some cute accessories, and with an expert like you by my side, nothing can go wrong!\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Kirara.\n\t- Kirara: Morning, Traveler! How do I look? 'Cause I feel pretty good!\n\t- Kirara: Oh, but don't worry — just because I'm feeling perky doesn't mean I'm gonna hunt any of your finches! Promise!\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good night, Kirara.\n\t- Kirara: Nighty night! There's just one last thing — and I'm not saying you will, but if you do end up hearing some crunching noises in your dreams... just know that it's perfectly normal.\n\t- Kirara: Ugh, fine, I—I'll try my best not to eat anything in the middle of the night.\n",

                "About Us: Principles": "Magicians generally do not reveal the core secrets behind their tricks, but if you don't mind becoming my apprentice and calling me \"Master Lyney,\" then that would be different. I'm curious how much of it you'd understand, and how long you'd last, hehe.",
                "About the Vision": "If a magician were to go onstage with their Vision in hand, people might suspect the authenticity of their tricks, so I habitually take it off before performing. But since you're interested, why don't you help me hold on to it while I perform? Just be sure to keep an eye on it, though — or it might just sneak its way back to me!",
                "Something to Share": "Magic isn't just a performance art, it's also a way of thinking. Many things in this world seem simple at first glance but play host to all sorts of secrets if you look deeper.",
                "Interesting Things": "Cats can use their ears to express their feelings. If they flatten them backwards, it indicates fear or caution, and if their ears are perked up and occasionally face forward, that usually means they're happy. Constant swiveling indicates that they are vigilantly assessing their surroundings... How do I know this? Experience and observation!",
                "About : Family": "\"Father\" gave us a family, raised us, and told each of us what we should work towards. In turn, what I can do is very simple... Remain loyal, and protect our home.",
                "About \"Father\": King": "Ours is a kingdom consisting only of children, and \"Father\" is our king. No king rules forever, of course, and I know that one day I will be chosen as \"Father's\" successor... But that also terrifies me... Please don't mention this to anyone, especially my sister and Freminet.",
                "About : Modes": "You think my sister doesn't talk much? Oh, she's probably just not in the right mode. Next time, start by saying \"Activate Chat Mode\" to her. If you're lucky, she might have a great deal of things to say to you. Hmm, and if you're not lucky...? Well, she'll just stare for a while, but hey, at least you'll get to see a different side of her!",
                "About Lynette: Twins": "My sister and I have always been inseparable. There's no hardship we can't overcome as long as we're together, and similarly, we share all our joys with each other. There's nothing in the world I treasure more than my family, so I know what it must be like for you... And if I find out anything at all that might help you, I'll be sure to let you know.",
                "About": "Have you ever gotten a whiff of the perfumes she makes? I quite liked them and was thinking to buy myself a bottle... But Lynette's tail indicated that she didn't share my opinion, so that was the end of that!",
                "More About Lyney: I": "It seems we're both keenly interested in each other. Well, know that the honor is mine! Haha, relax. I couldn't ever tell lies to your mesmerizing eyes — not even if I tried!",
                "More About Lyney: II": "Of course, there's no way to ensure that you'll never slip up when performing magic tricks. The way I see it, the point is not to perform perfectly, but to stay calm at all times and adapt as needed. Even if some small flaws occur, you just need to make the audience believe that it's all part of the show, and you'll still deliver an entertaining and unforgettable performance!",
                "More About Lyney: III": "As orphans without parents to shelter us, Lynette and I were forced to roam the streets since childhood, so we've been through a lot. But those experiences have also made us who we are today. We're doing alright these days. I have a hat full of hopes and dreams... Heh, and a family, and audience, hoping that I don't let them down!",
                "More About Lyney: IV": "Haha, so even now you still don't completely trust me, huh? You're a vigilant one — not that that's a bad thing. I'll never need to worry about you getting duped by someone else. But on the other hand, since you've taken it upon yourself to watch my every move, you'd better be careful when you blink... Who knows, I might just tell a huge, terrible lie while you're not paying attention! You'd be in a real pickle then, wouldn't you?",
                "More About Lyney: V": "Actually, the real me is nowhere near as outgoing or chatty as I appear. More often than not, I only work my verbal \"magic\" as a means of getting closer to people. Sometimes I think people would feel sorry for the real me. Do you? *sigh* Or do you find my little games absurd?",
                "Lyney's Hobbies": "Hey, what do we have here? Ah, a cute, little white rabbit — you like it? Curious about when it got here? You should be! Hehe, the look of amazement on our audience's face is what we magicians love the most.",
                "Lyney's Troubles: It's All a Disguise": "Ah, what to do, what to do? The thing that troubles me is... the fact that you can even think of troubling things when you have such a great magician like myself standing right in front of you.",
                "Lyney's Troubles: Doves": "In the past, I would let the doves I raised fly freely, and they would always return to me. But there was once when a few didn't return, and by the time we tracked them down, they'd been turned into dove pie. Even now I still don't know how to give them both freedom and safety.",
                "Favorite Food": "See this fishbowl? Come, put your hand inside it. Filled with just ordinary water, right? Are you sure? Then let's begin! See this cloth? I'm going to cover the bowl with it and... Well, what do you know? There's a fish in there now! How was that? Maybe this fun little performance could earn me one of your very own fish dishes?",
                "Least Favorite Food": "Our performances require that Lynette and I have matching physiques, so we have to avoid eating any oily food. Now, that's not a huge problem for me, but it can be tough for my sister — the fried fish they sell on the streets smells amazing, after all...",
                "Receiving a Gift: I": "It's quite an honor to enjoy such wonderful food made by you.",
                "Receiving a Gift: II": "My, this is delicious! You're quite the cook. Thanks for the treat.",
                "Receiving a Gift: III": "Would you like to see a magic trick? Now, let me place this ordinary cloth on top of the dish. Count down with me — three, two, one! Tada! Where'd the food go?",
                "Birthday": "I have a feather here, just an ordinary feather... Go ahead, you can hold it and see for yourself. Ready? And... boom! It was a party popper all along. Happy Birthday! See this? I caught one of the paper streamers floating down. Now, make a wish and picture a birthday gift in your mind's eye as I light it. Three... two... one... Great! Verrry good, I know exactly what you were thinking now. The last step, put your hand inside my hat... Well? Is it the gift you wanted?",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Intro": "Oho, and here I thought you'd ask me to perform some magic with these materials!",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up": "Would you be more shocked if nothing changed about me at all?",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Climax": "Nothing could make me happier than having your trust.",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion": "Doing all this for me... Are you trying to steal this magician's heart, by any chance? Well, in that case, congratulations, my dear apprentice — or should I say, \"companion.\" For you have succeeded!"

Even a legendary magician like myself can confidently say I've never seen or heard of anything like it!\n\t- Lyney: But were I to say I've already gotten completely used to it... Would you think I'm lying?\n\t- Traveler: Sure doesn't seem like the truth.\n\t\t- Lyney: Aw, that really hurts my feelings...\n\t\t- Lyney: But, I was really being honest this time!\n\t\t- Lyney: Well, looks like I've got no choice but to stay here for a while longer! After all, it will take some time for me to win your trust again.\n\t\t- Lyney: ...You won't kick me out, right?\n\t- Traveler: No, I trust you.\n\t\t- Lyney: Hehe, I'm honored to have gained your trust.\n\t\t- Lyney: It's almost impossible for me to lie to your face... Maybe it's because I can't bear to see that hurt expression of yours.\n\t\t- Lyney: Ahem, but back to the topic at hand! Since you care about me so much, surely you would also want me to extend my stay?\n\t\t- Lyney: In which case, I'll be looking forward to more of your hospitality!\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to chat?\n\t- Lyney: Sure thing! Say, why don't you take a look at my hat? Do you see anything different about it?\n\t- Traveler: Huh... Don't think there's any difference.\n\t- Lyney: Ah, but that just means you need to look at it more carefully! Just come a bit closer.\n\t- Traveler: Well, alright then.\n\t- Lyney: So, do you have the answer? Is it the pattern, or the color? You should have seen this hat many times before.\n\t- Traveler: ...Nope, still not seeing it.\n\t\t- Lyney: *sigh* What a pity... Although, your conclusion is actually correct.\n\t- Traveler: Is it bigger or smaller than before?\n\t\t- Lyney: No, the whole thing was misdirection.\n\t- Lyney: I just played a little trick, and stole something of yours. And after that, I also slipped a card into your bag.\n\t- Lyney: Now, can you guess what I stole from you?\n\t- Traveler: My wallet?\n\t\t- Lyney: Haha, I really am quite the little thief with a nose for Mora! No wonder my pockets are always overflowing.\n\t\t- Lyney: What I actually stole, however, was your \"attention.\" That's something far more valuable than Mora!\n\t- Traveler: My heart?\n\t\t- Lyney: A most unexpected answer! I have to say, even my heart has begun to race too.\n\t\t- Lyney: What I actually stole, however, was your \"attention.\" Even though it's not nearly as valuable as your heart, it's still very important to us magicians nonetheless!\n\t- Traveler: My... attention?\n\t\t- Lyney: Bingo! Congratulations, that was the right answer.\n\t- Lyney: As long as you understand and master this trick, and put some time into practicing movement, you, too, can become an outstanding magician.\n\t- Lyney: ...Okay, you can return my card to me now.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?\n\t- Lyney: As you're the owner, there is one matter on which I would like to inquire your opinion.\n\t- Traveler: ...Huh? Why so formal all of a sudden...\n\t- Lyney: From what I can see, not only is the environment here quite comfortable, but the security is also beyond reproach. It seems this would be a great place to raise pets.\n\t- Traveler: Yeah, I have a few.\n\t\t- Lyney: Just so you know... I've already greeted them. Politely, of course.\n\t\t- Lyney: I refrained from touching them or feeding them anything I had brought with me. Such actions require your permission first, no?\n\t\t- Traveler: Why do I feel like you're being exceptionally earnest today...\n\t- Traveler: I don't really have much experience with pets...\n\t\t- Lyney: No problem. As long as you aren't opposed to the idea, I'm happy to share my knowledge on the subject with you.\n\t\t- Lyney: Naturally, if you have any concerns, I will respect your thoughts and decisions.\n\t\t- Traveler: Why do I feel like you're being exceptionally earnest today...\n\t- Lyney: Hehe, is it because I'm usually dramatic and flamboyant? That could have left you with a rather one-sided impression.\n\t- Lyney: If that's the case, I really ought to do a good bit of self-reflection!\n\t- Lyney: Anyway, I just want to find a warm, free, and peaceful home for all of my animal assistants.\n\t- Lyney: A place where they'll always enjoy care and being lovingly looked after, with no need to worry about food or shelter...\n\t- Lyney: To be perfectly honest with you, this is by far the best choice for them that I know of... but I wouldn't want you to feel pressured to take them in, or to persuade you using honeyed words.\n\t- Lyney: But if you really were willing to take them in of your own free will, truly, that would be wonderful.\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Morning, Lyney.\n\t- Lyney: Good morning, Traveler!\n\t- Lyney: It would be great if I could see you every morning.\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good night, Lyney.\n\t- Lyney: Good night, Traveler.\n\t- Lyney: If you ever have trouble falling asleep, I'd be happy to count cats with you until you drift off.\n",

Everything here is really nice. And I'm used to it now, so there's no need to worry about me.\n\t- Traveler: It's okay. You don't have to be so polite.\n\t\t- Freminet: Sorry...\n\t\t- Freminet: I'm just worried that if I just say everything on my mind, I might cause unnecessary misunderstandings.\n\t- Traveler: You can tell me how you really feel.\n\t\t- Freminet: Heh... Are you really sure about that?\n\t- Freminet: ...\n\t- Freminet: ...Alright, then in that case, I'll do as you ask...\n\t- Freminet: To tell you the truth, I—I'm actually a little homesick.\n\t- Freminet: Even though this place is really comfortable, and the environment here is flawless, I just... can't seem to get used to life here.\n\t- Freminet: This is nobody's problem but my own, so... Please don't think I'm upset with you, or unsatisfied about anything in this place.\n\t- Freminet: ...I hope you can forgive me.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to chat?\n\t- Freminet: Mhm... Please go ahead.\n\t- Traveler: Why don't we talk about Pers?\n\t- Freminet: ...Ah, thank you for remembering its name.\n\t- Traveler: Is there a story behind Pers's name?\n\t- Traveler: Why does Pers look the way it does?\n\t- Freminet: To explain it... I'll need to tell you a really, really old story I once read in a picture book.\n\t- Traveler: Ooh, I'm listening!\n\t- Freminet: Mhm... So once upon a time, in a faraway seaside town, there lived a black and white bird.\n\t- Freminet: Since birth, it spoke with a stutter, walked with a wobble, and was unable to fly, so it was always bullied by the other birds.\n\t- Freminet: Until one day, greedy pirates stole a jewel-studded diadem from the underwater palace...\n\t- Freminet: In a flash, lightning and thunder engulfed the sea, and a tsunami rose from the depths, threatening to wipe out the entire town...\n\t- Freminet: The black-and-white bird tried to leap upwards, but it still couldn't fly... In its recklessness, it crashed against the mast and sank into the ocean alongside the wrecked ship.\n\t- Freminet: The seabirds flying overhead thought it would drown right then and there, but to their surprise, it began to swim like the swiftest of fish!\n\t- Freminet: It swam and swam, until its strength finally gave out. It restored the diadem to its rightful place underwater, and immediately, the storms died down, and it was as if nothing bad had ever happened.\n\t- Freminet: As you've probably guessed by now... The bird in the story was named Pers. It was a penguin that came to town by accident.\n\t- Traveler: What a wonderful story.\n\t- Traveler: Ah, I didn't know you were friends with a hero!\n\t\t- Freminet: ...Heh, you're right.\n\t- Freminet: I've always admired the Pers in the story, but after reading it, what struck me the most was... its loneliness.\n\t- Freminet: So, I decided to stick close and hug Pers, so we can keep each other warm...\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?\n\t- Freminet: Hmm... Could I trouble you to accompany me to a few places when you're free?\n\t- Freminet: I'd like to visit Lepaute Horlogerie, Beaumont Workshop, and the Vasari Passage.\n\t- Traveler: Sure thing.\n\t- Traveler: Is there anything in particular you're interested in?\n\t- Freminet: Mhm... I'd like to take a look at their clockwork crafts, as well as the variety of small mechanisms they usually have to offer.\n\t- Freminet: I'm a regular of Leschots', but whenever I pass by the other shops, I can't help but be curious...\n\t- Freminet: What lies hidden deep within those shops? What if there's something there that's both original and exquisitely designed?\n\t- Freminet: What I wouldn't give to be able to see everything for myself! If only... *sigh*\n\t- Freminet: See, I'm... not very good at dealing with people, and if I spent a lot of time gawking at the wares without paying a single coin, I'm sure the shopkeepers would get mad at me.\n\t- Freminet: So, if you could step in at that point, and help me...\n\t- Traveler: Explain on your behalf?\n\t\t- Freminet: Yeah... Something like that. I know it's might be awkward, but...\n\t- Traveler: Pay for the wares?\n\t\t- Freminet: Eh!? No, no, of course not! That's not what I meant at all...\n\t\t- Freminet: Just a few words of explanation... should be enough.\n\t- Freminet: I'll pay you back, I swear! As long as it's something I can do...\n\t- Traveler: No problem.\n\t- Freminet: Ahh, thank you so much! I'm... not dreaming, am I?\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Freminet.\n\t- Freminet: Good morning.\n\t- Freminet: I'm... just going to stay here if you don't have any special assignments.\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good night, Freminet.\n\t- Freminet: Good night, Traveler.\n\t- Freminet: \"May your dreams be as dazzling as the starry night above the ocean, and your dreamless nights be naught but filled with serene respite.\"\n",

He is notably perceptive, being able to hear Paimon's whispers and is able to deduce the additional details from the evidence provided to him during a trial. He utilizes the  to make the final decision, honoring its request regardless of his own feelings on the matter as per protocol.\n\nDue to his position and ties to the Hydro Archon, he is popular among Fontaine's people as a symbol of justice and honor. As a member of the , Neuvillette is unfamiliar with human customs and feelings, using the court to help him process and understand them. He rarely spends his time out in public, as he does not enjoy unwanted attention, and in the few times he speaks to humans, he appears to be aloof, though honest in his words. However, when interacting with s, he is extremely friendly, seen as the ideal father by them; likewise, he is fiercely protective of them, considering them the pride of Fontaine and investigating matters himself should he hear of a Melusine being bullied or threatened. \n\nWhen he was initially reincarnated, Neuvillette was left with many questions about himself, leading to him accepting a position as the Iudex. His time overseeing trials led him to experience a plethora of human experiences and emotions, which was secretly prepared by  in the hopes that his newfound perception would save the people of Fontaine from a  that would exterminate them. Upon learning the full extent of Focalors' deception, he admitted that she was devious and was both saddened and shocked by her self-sacrifice. Indeed, having seen humanity positively, Neuvillette used his fully restored powers to save the people and left aside fragments of his power in the form of s for those worthy of them.\n\nNatural as a Dragon Sovereign, Neuvillette opposes the  and by extension, . \n\nDespite his appearance, Neuvillette enjoys water and is an avid taster, being able to discern the properties of where the water came from and how it's prepared; as a result, this also extends to him liking food with plenty of sauce. He does not like deep fried food and grilled food with no sauce, especially taking great offence to s."

I don't mean to condescend to humanity, but it is quite clear to me that society's concepts of justice, fairness, equality, and rule of law are not equivalent, and can never be. Now of course, water always seeks its own level, and it was in this spirit that the previous Hydro Archon, Egeria, hoped to achieve universal equality by connecting all things with love. Her successor chose instead to seek equality by means of the law. But ultimately, due to various external factors, this unfortunately manifested itself in the distorted form of trials for the sake of trials. Nevertheless, there are reasons for everything.

Nevertheless, my grievances with the usurpers have yet to be settled... They owe a debt of blood that shall not be forgotten.",
                "About the : I": "I was once advised to wear a counterfeit Vision, so that I might more easily intervene during moments of crisis. To be quite frank, I was not enamored by this suggestion, nor the implication that one must only exercise the power that is rightfully theirs under false pretenses. With that said, however, I have developed a newfound appreciation for the value of human yearning and determination having spent considerable time around Vision-bearing humans.",

                "Something to Share: Laws": "Fontaine does have some rather intriguing laws on its books. For instance, \"it is forbidden to release any flying objects during the first three days of each month,\" \"during the dry season, all bivalves that wash ashore belong to the , while other mollusks belong to the people,\" \"no domestic pets shall be named after ,\" \"tomato ketchup is to be consumed in restaurants only as a condiment, never on its own,\" and, finally, \"Melusines are to be addressed using she/her pronouns, never the impersonal it/its\"... That last one was my personal contribution.",
                "Something to Share: Rainy Days": "Some days, my mind wanders, and I fantasize about walking into the rain... *sigh* Ah, but don't worry, my flights of fancy don't distract me from my work.",
                "Interesting Things:": "The Vishaps' ancestry can be traced directly back to the , which is why they are so adept at evolution. I am reminded of an old custom that the dragons once observed: We would take a sip of our perished young brethren's blood. Whenever the tides are disrupted by the motion of the moon and stars, the water within the bodies of us  organisms surges up towards our heads, reminding us that our deceased kin will soon be revived.",
                "Interesting Things: Humans": "From my observations, humans have a tendency to view themselves as being in opposition with nature. And whenever this point is raised, someone is always quick to respond by declaring that humans are in fact a part of nature, like any other organism. To someone like me, however, who knows an inkling of the truth, what would be most beneficial is if human civilization and the natural world of this planet could seek ways to co-exist with one another.",
                "About the": "Though the day will come when I put her on trial, I must commend the God of Verdure on her sense of responsibility. Few things are without flaws in this world, but the devotion and benevolence she displays are a testament to her commitment to continued progress. I felt enormous regret when I learned of the mistreatment she has endured over the past five hundred years.",
                "About": "I regret to say that after my various interactions with her — such as when I inadvertently angered her, and when I accepted her apology — and even now, in spite of the guilt I continue to feel over what happened to , I feel... very distant from her, as if I'm observing the starry sky from the bottom of a deep lake. It is by no means intentional, and I also know it is not something that I can easily make up for. Unlike water, emotion does not settle quickly once agitated, nor is it naturally inclined towards equilibrium.",
                "About Lyney and Lynette": "Their performances are just fascinating, don't you think? They draw you into a magical world where, on one hand, everything that takes place is part of an elaborate deception — but on the other, all manner of miracles are possible if you are only willing to believe.",
                "More About Neuvillette: I": "I usually do my best to avoid forming personal relationships, or even collaborating with others outside of established procedures. But you have shown yourself to be trustworthy, and you have no problematic entanglements with Fontaine's local factions. Therefore, I would be pleased to journey with you.",
                "More About Neuvillette: II": "This is something that I can only say in private — I could never publicly share my views on this matter: It positively baffles me that  has managed to become such a popular drink. Though, I suppose its appeal to humans is not beyond comprehension. One can both rehydrate and replenish blood sugar in one gulp, and at an exceptionally cheap price.",
                "More About Neuvillette: III": "I went to see an opera recently. It was about a lady whose personal charm and manipulative schemes allowed her to continue to dominate the affairs of the grand mansion where she lived even after her death, like a ghost that refused to be exorcised. The acting was impeccable, and the story exceptional. It also reminded me of the current state of affairs in the real world.",
                "More About Neuvillette: IV": "For a number of reasons, I rarely leave Fontaine. As a result, though I enjoy tasting spring water from all over the world, I always have it delivered to me here, rather than collecting it myself. And yes, subtle as the flavor differences between samples of different regions may be, I am perfectly capable of distinguishing between them. Do you still doubt me? I am the Iudex. I do not lie.",
                "More About Neuvillette: V": "I have to say, my daily life is not without its inconveniences. For instance, I often find myself stepping on my robes as I sit down, or squashing my coiffure against the chair. And if I lean my head too far back, sometimes my hair even gets caught in the ornamentation. Nevertheless, I must wear these garments to maintain the dignity of a Chief Justice, and endure whatever inconveniences this entails. Incidentally, the world at large appears to operate on this general principle, too. Everyone is faced with an identity that they must accept, endure, understand, and eventually learn to co-exist with. This has been my experience all along.",
                "Neuvillette's Hobbies": "Water tasting is a rather sophisticated discipline. -heated water has the standard \"au naturel\" flavor found ubiquitously in the natural world, while water boiled using charcoal has distinctly rustic notes. Similarly, while -chilled water is cold but otherwise unremarkable, the frozen rivers of , when melted, produce a water with an entirely different flavor profile altogether.",
                "Neuvillette's Troubles": "People seem to respond to the sight of a man in the rain without an umbrella as if it were some sort of strange spectacle.",
                "Favorite Food": "Animals can survive for weeks without food, but merely a few days without water. There is no dish that could ever compare to pure, unadulterated water. With that in mind, food items that contain plenty of liquid are the next best thing.",
                "Least Favorite Food": "How can people bring themselves to consume deep-fried foods? Or grilled food with no sauce? The worst culprits in my view are those s. Surely, even eating a dehumidifying agent would be kinder on the stomach?",

Aware of the  that would doom Fontaine, Furina assumed the role of Hydro Archon for 500 years; while she was successful in this task, it wore her down mentally that she suffered from severe self-esteem issues and paranoia, as shown when the  convinced the court audience that she was a fraud in her trial.\n\nUpon being freed of her role as an acting Archon, Furina had returned to her normal self, but without the burdens associated with her role. While she is still flamboyant and dramatic at times, she now displays a softer, humbler and insecure side of herself. At first, she struggled coming to terms with her role being over, believing that her newfound freedom meant that she was no longer needed, and had trouble reaching out for the people closest to her while she was the Archon, such as Neuvillette and . She also planned to retire from the stage despite her love of acting, finding it difficult to take on different identities after having to sustain such a heavy burden for centuries. After being comforted by the Traveler, Neuvillette, and Navia as well as getting invited to a party by Clorinde, she realizes that her journey of self-discovery means that she no longer has to live her life in solitude. Eventually, she is able to regain the courage to move forward and go back onstage for the first time since her abdication, and learns to accept her identity not as the Hydro Archon, but simply as herself, culminating in her receiving a Hydro Vision."

People who stand on the stage basking in the adulation of their audience must also bear the pressures of being in the public eye and living up to everyone's expectations. But I knew very well my person wouldn't be enough, and that putting on the act of a god would be able the only way to satisfy their adoration... And at the end of the day, all I ever experienced was loneliness. So there came a point when I loathed the very thought of acting and locked myself in my room. It wasn't until the moment I stood on stage and faced the audience again that I realized the anxiety in my heart had dissipated. The reason I can now stand before the crowd's watchful gaze is perhaps because... I have finally started to act as myself.",

Only my performances would draw a completely sold-out crowd... even standing tickets would be out. But now... Uh... I've already decided to hang up my acting career, so it's perfectly normal for my popularity to decline!",

I do miss her ever so slightly, but I don't have any real reason to see her now. Oh, right! I should invite her to my next tea party!",
                "About : Desserts": "Have you tried Navia's macarons? I have to admit that her skills in dessert-making are comparable to mine. The design she paints on the macarons is so cute, don't you think? Not to mention the texture and sweetness... They truly are a work of art! How does she do it? Does it really all boil down to talent? Ugh, I can't believe I'm feeling a little jealous... I'll have to ask her for some tips next time!",
                "About Navia: Inner Thoughts": "She's a very strong person. Strong people will always manage to keep themselves together no matter what happens, acting like everything is fine. Doing so prevents other people around them from needlessly bearing additional pressure. I saw the duel between  and ... and I can say that in this respect, Navia is becoming more and more like her father.",

Every day, countless journalists would come flocking around me, trying to get the inside scoop on my personal life, so I have loads of experience rejecting them. Of course, I don't intend to use this experience on you. With the right delicacies, I might be willing to exchange some of my secrets.",

Keeping balance on the rolling waves was a little tricky at first, but I managed to get the hang of it pretty quickly. Maybe I'm just a natural surfer...

But, when I'm with you, I seem to constantly feel happy... Such an amazing feeling!",

In my efforts to maintain the reserved manner of a deity, I never got the chance to enjoy my life, which is why I've become obsessed with shopping lately. I've bought many new precious things... like dazzling rainbow-colored tea bags, fully-automated extendable cutlery, and a saddle specially made for riding Seahorses... But in the end, I realized that most of the stuff I bought was useless, so I sent them all to the troupe to be used as props in performances. Strange... before I bought those things, I was certain they would all be of good use to me...",
                "More About Furina: V": "People love talking about the past and often regret the beautiful things that have now faded into history. They also love to talk about the future, as if they're willing to sacrifice everything for an uncertain tomorrow. I don't agree with their way of thinking, yet I also feel very envious... I once lived in a world without a past or a future. To cope with that anxiety, I tried to create and act out a stronger, more god-like version of myself. Over the centuries, the stronger role I tried to play gradually merged with my real self. Even I can't separate the two now... but perhaps there's no need to distinguish them. Experiences of the past have formed who I am now, and that flawed performance has also become the most important part of me.",

Everything from choosing the characters to imagining the setting requires a lot of effort in order to make the final performance a hit!",

What's \"Happy Day\"? *sigh* Well, I wanted to keep it a surprise... But it's an opera that I've rehearsed personally.

So, it falls to you to entertain me with a thrilling conversation!\n- Traveler: How do you like it here?\n\t- Furina: I like it a lot. The view here is amazing wherever you look, and the weather is quite pleasant. One would be hard-pressed to find a better location for a vacation.\n\t- Furina: I had no idea that you'd purchased such an enormous plot of land... And it's amazing what you've done with the place. You must have put a lot of time and thought into it.\n\t- Traveler: Well, I didn't \"purchase\" it, exactly...\n\t- Furina: Oh, I remember now... Some kind of mystic art from Liyue, was it? However did they do it?\n\t- Furina: I'd really love to take this teapot apart and learn more about it. Although, I'm not too confident that I'd be able to put it back together correctly afterwards... On second thought, forget I said anything.\n\t- Furina: This place is truly fascinating. It seems to be brimming with infinite possibilities... The only downside is how quiet and secluded it is. Don't you ever get lonely, living here by yourself?\n\t- Furina: There must be a way you could liven things up a little here. Hmm... Ah, yes — how about hosting a ball here? I'm sure Fontaine's social elite would jump at the chance to fraternize with you. They'd flock here in droves, and everyone would be singing and dancing to their hearts' content.\n\t- Traveler: I see this place more as a private home.\n\t- Traveler: I prefer to only bring my closest companions here.\n\t- Furina: Oh, uh... I—I see. Then... in that case, let's organize a smaller-scale private dance!\n\t- Furina: You don't need to invite throngs of people, or put up fancy decorations. We can simply let the world be our stage, and dance whenever and wherever the mood takes us.\n\t- Furina: ...Well come on, don't just stand there! Take some initiative!\n\t- Traveler: May I invite you to dance?\n\t- Furina: 'Twould be my pleasure. ...Um... You do know how to dance, don't you...?\n\t- Traveler: Oh, that...\n\t- Traveler: ...Kind of?\n\t- Furina: Alright, just take my hand. Now, relax your arms a little, and stand with your feet a shoulder-width apart.\n\t- Furina: Once we start, just follow my lead and you'll be fine. Don't worry — I'm the brightest star in all of Fontaine. You're in good hands.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?\n\t- Furina: A chat, you say... A simple word, but a fascinating idea.\n\t- Furina: Through the power of words, people who are worlds apart can come to understand one another's innermost thoughts.\n\t- Furina: But conversations can come with a great risk as well. The deeper you let someone in, the more deeply they can wound you...\n\t- Furina: That's why people are just as afraid of intimacy as they are of being alone.\n\t- Traveler: I wasn't expecting you to start philosophizing on the human condition...\n\t- Furina: Hey! I just gave a very moving speech! Is that all you can say!?\n\t- Furina: When one is blessed with both beauty and depth as I am, one naturally has many musings on the vicissitudes of life. All the best moments in opera are grounded in real-life observation.\n\t- Traveler: So... you're not a fan of chatting?\n\t- Furina: I didn't mean that... It popped into my head, that's all: \"People are just as afraid of intimacy as they are of being alone.\" And I thought wow, that's a good line...\n\t- Furina: Surely you've had that before too? You know, where you really wanna say something profound that makes everyone go: \"Wow. That was deep.\"\n\t- Traveler: ...Okay, yeah. I've done that before.\n\t\t- Furina: Good! I appreciate your honesty. All it means is that you're well-suited to stand under the spotlight.\n\t\t- Furina: I've played so many solo performances in the past that I've gotten a bit bored of them. Why don't you join me? We can be a protagonist duo, and expand our repertoire...\n\t\t- Furina: Let me think for a second... What shows are popular right now that have a good role for you?\n\t\t- Furina: Ooh, I know! I saw a pretty decent opera the other day. Why don't we practise a few scenes together? C'mon, I'll do your makeup, we'll make it a dress rehearsal!\n\t- Traveler: Nope, never.\n\t\t- Furina: Are you serious? Surely I can't be the only one... No, nononono. I bet you just haven't realized how fun it is yet.\n\t\t- Furina: Why don't you give it a try? Just focus on what your feelings are telling you, and try to articulate that in a serious-sounding way.\n\t\t- Furina: Technically, it counts as a kind of performance — but don't let that get to you, there's no pressure. Just say whatever words come into your mind!\n\t\t- Traveler: \"Life... is like a play that never ends.\"\n\t\t- Traveler: \"As a prisoner in the Fortress of Meropide longs for the light of day, so is my yearning.\"\n\t\t- Furina: Hmm... How should I put this... That was pretty good, for an beginner.\n\t\t- Furina: Starting out is always the hardest part. Keep practising, and before you know it you'll be able to show all the sides of yourself that no one's ever seen before. Just like me.\n\t\t- Furina: When that time comes, we can rehearse together, maybe even work on a new script together. A lot of classics were made that way, you know. And doesn't it sound like fun?\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?\n\t- Furina: Mmm... Heh... There are probably as many things that I want to do right now as there are stars in the sky.\n\t- Furina: I think my top priority, though, would be to add some more furnishings to this place.\n\t- Traveler: Oh... You don't like how this place currently looks?\n\t- Furina: Hey, don't be upset...! I never said there was anything wrong with this place as it stands...\n\t- Furina: However... Pretty furnishings are like extra outfits in the wardrobe — you can never have too many of them.\n\t- Furina: That's especially true for tea parties. You've got to switch up the furnishings and decorations every now and then to keep things fresh and new.\n\t- Furina: A lot of people might say that it's best to stick to what's tried and tested, but I think it's possible to respect tradition while trying something new at the same time.\n\t- Traveler: That was great! Didn't know you had it in you.\n\t\t- Furina: I'm glad you appreciate my point of view. That tells me that you're an interesting person as well.\n\t- Traveler: You really are a fount of wisdom, Furina!\n\t\t- Furina: Hehe, well, when it comes to things I'm interested in, I don't mind putting in the time to become the most knowledgeable person in the topic.\n\t- Furina: Anyway, since I brought up the idea of getting some more furnishings, let me provide the funds.\n\t- Furina: Don't worry, Surintendante Chevalmarin hasn't approached me about my overspending so far this month. Which means, I still have plenty of Mora left in my private reserve.\n\t- Traveler: You... overspend a lot?\n\t\t- Furina: Uh... I—I mean, what choice do I have...? There are so many lovely and fascinating things in the world, one simply has to have them...\n\t\t- Furina: *sigh* Alright, yes, I should rein in my spending habits a little... Starting from next month!\n\t- Traveler: Your \"private reserve\"?\n\t\t- Furina: Ah, I just mean my savings from my performance fees. I thought I'd mentioned it to you before, no? I've done the occasional paid performance over the past few centuries, and it all added up, so I do have some personal savings.\n\t\t- Furina: I turned the whole pot over to Surintendante Chevalmarin to manage. She's a lot better at investments and trading than me.\n\t\t- Furina: I shouldn't have to worry about my finances for quite some time. So even though Surintendante Chevalmarin makes a budget for me each month, it doesn't matter if I spend a little extra now and then.\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Furina.\n\t- Furina: Good morning. Huh... that came around quickly.\n\t- Furina: I must have slept exceptionally well last night. Shall we head out and have some fun today...?\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good night, Furina.\n\t- Furina: Good night. Phew... I often find that in the stillness of the night, all my troubles come back to haunt me.\n\t- Furina: You know what? I'm not going to dwell over them anymore! Let's just get some rest.\n",

                "When the Sun Is Out": "Perfect lighting for a photo! C'mon, strike a pose. Don't forget to smile!",
                "Good Morning": "Morning! Did you read the paper yet? No? ...No worries, I'll read it for you...",
                "Good Afternoon": "Lunch time! Come with me — I know a great place!",
                "Good Evening": "Time for an evening chat. Any stories you're willing to share? I'd love to hear them. ...Oh, don't worry, I won't print any of them without your permission. You have my word.",
                "Good Night": "Good night. You go get some rest — I gotta head to The Steambird offices to do some final proofreading of some articles. See you tomorrow!",
                "About Charlotte: Career": "People aren't always very fond of journalists. You know what they say — lies are soft and malleable, but the truth is sharp and inflexible.",
                "About Charlotte: Photography": "I can't take a good photograph without an interesting subject. I really have to force myself to press the shutter button if I'm not excited by what I'm snapping.",
                "About Us: Exclusive Feature": "Alright, the time has come for your interview. Ready to be a star? Just follow my lead and try to look good for the Kamera! You too, Paimon — you have the power of flight! Could you try to make it look a little more exciting?",
                "About Us: Headliners": "Good news — I've convinced Euphrasie to make you the next headliners of The Steambird! You'll be right up there on the front cover, there'll be a whole feature about you that I wrote myself, and— Huh? What do you mean, \"no need\"? C'mon, I've been pushing Euphrasie for ages on this! Can't you reconsider? I'll make it up to you, I promise! I'll treat you to a huge meal, pleeease?",
                "About the": "To be honest... I'd prefer to have an  Vision. Being able to fly around freely would make getting to interviews sooo much easier! A  Vision's not too bad, though. At least I don't need to worry about my Kamera overheating.",
                "Something to Share": "\"Your credible source of the unbelievable truth!\" That's my journalistic motto. Hmm? ...Haha, yep, exactly — \"credible\" and \"incredible\" at the same time! What's that? ...Oh, if I had to choose, then obviously being credible is much more important! But most readers would sooner pay money for sensational stories than mundane facts... So we have to focus on the most incredible true stories to keep our readers engaged.",
                "Interesting Things": "Allow me to introduce the one and only Monsieur Verite. He's not just any Kamera — he's my trusty companion and assistant. See his little hat and bow tie? I had those custom made by Chiori. Pretty neat, huh? I've got loads of other outfits for him too, all in different styles. He comes dressed to impress for every interview, whatever the occasion!",
                "About": "Lady Furina has a very captivating presence. She was born to be a star. Euphrasie once assigned a journalist to shadow her, but he quit not long into the assignment... From what I've heard, the reason he left was that Furina insisted on seeing every photo he took of her right away, and she'd make him redo it if she wasn't happy with how it turned out. Apparently, she was so picky that the poor guy once had to take 127 shots of her in the same pose before she was content...",
                "More About Charlotte: I": "I'm well aware that following the truth wherever it leads is risky business. But buried truths make exclusive news, so good luck trying to keep secrets from me when we need a good story... telling journalist like me in this world with a strong sense of journalistic integrity! Ahem! I make it my goal to provide the public with only the best exclusive news, through powerful, engaging, and honest reporting!",
                "More About Charlotte: II": "When I first started working as a journalist, I didn't know anything about how to write the news, so I had to figure it all out for myself by reading articles by other people. As well as The Steambird, I also looked at some other independent publications out there, which tend to be more specialized. For example, there's \"The Observer\" for celebrity gossip, \"Leisure Weekly,\" which focuses on competitive sport and other entertainment news, \"Top Chef\" for those who like to read... all the food critiques in one place, and \"Bedazzled!\" which is just sort of a glorified rumor and speculation mill. I learned a whole lot from reading all those papers. Or... Well, I at least learned how to master a bunch of different writing styles.",
                "More About Charlotte: III": "I once spent six months working undercover for an exposé piece about a merchant who was selling shoddy food products. I disguised myself as a vagrant, infiltrated the back kitchen, took a job as a kitchen hand, and stuck around until I'd gathered enough solid evidence about their misdeeds. Then, I put it all in an article and had it published in the paper. The backlash was intense. They were punished for their crimes, sure, but that didn't stop them from launching a vicious campaign of vengeance against me almost immediately. I was coming home to threat letters sitting on my bedside table on a daily basis, and we'd also find mud slung on the front door to our office... The Steambird quickly filed a report to the Gardes, and I was sent to Mondstadt to report on Genius Invokation TCG. It took a while before I could safely return to Fontaine. These kind of things happen all the time. I honestly don't know Euphrasie deals with it...",
                "More About Charlotte: IV": "I've always been a very curious person. Even as a kid, long before I ever thought about going into journalism, I was always convinced that secrets and mysteries were lurking in every corner... To me, the world is a giant hoard of hidden treasure, with countless stories waiting to be uncovered. Every time I see something where I think a secret might be hiding, I snap a photo with my Kamera and add it to my collection. These photos are like my own personal treasure map... and I'm constantly going back to them, trying new ways to decipher them and expose the truth.",
                "More About Charlotte: V": "I don't really care whether these hidden truths are significant, what they mean, or what the wider ramifications are... I just want to bring them into the light of day. To put it in adventurer terms, I guess for me... it's all about the thrill of the chase, and not the treasure at the end. I've also met a lot of people along the way: all my Fontaine friends, Euphrasie, who believes I was born to be a journalist, and people like you, who join me in the search for the truth. Without everyone's help, I'd probably still be that nosy kid who runs around furiously snapping photos like a lunatic... Anywho... It's not often that I get to be the interviewee, but... this has been a real pleasure.",
                "Charlotte's Hobbies": "I love collecting different Kamera lenses. They all have different strengths — some might have an incredible range of focal lengths, others might have a really wide field of view. Oh, and there's also more novelty ones that can apply special effects to the image. Take this one, for example — when you take a portrait photo with this, it turns their face all chubby... C'mon, I'll take one of you! And you, !",
                "Charlotte's Troubles": "I've ended up with a less-than-favorable reputation in some people's eyes — I think it's because I can sometimes be a little bit, um... intense in interviews. Now, whenever I show up to interview someone, they're always really wary of me... *sigh* But in my defense, with some people, you really have to put the pressure on or they won't open up...",
                "Favorite Food": "Hehe, sweet things are my weakness. However big the main meal, I can always manage a dessert or several. Or as my mother puts it... There's always a special place reserved in my stomach for dessert!",
                "Least Favorite Food": "Spicy food doesn't agree with me at all. It's like my stomach is fitted with a super-sensitive spice detector or something, 'cause even the mildest hint of chili will set it off. One small bite and the stomachache begins... and it always lasts for like an entire day, ugh...",
                "Receiving a Gift: I": "You're a good chef! Any interest in starting a culinary column in our paper? I know just how we could slot you in.",
                "Receiving a Gift: II": "Hey, not bad... Would you mind teaching me to make this some time?",
                "Receiving a Gift: III": "Whewee... This is uh, a juicy news story... with a gut-wrenching conclusion...",
                "Birthday": "Happy Birthday! Did you read today's Steambird yet? I put a birthday greeting in there for you, hehe... Wait, you still haven't bought a copy? No problem, I picked one up before leaving the office. Look — here it is! I fought pretty hard to get it on this page.",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Intro": "What a strange and wonderful feeling... I've gotta write this down for my records.",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up": "So this stuff really does boost people's strength, huh? I thought it was all rumors, but now here I am, experiencing it for myself...",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Climax": "Have you done this for other people in the past, too? Were the materials you used different, and if so, how? Also, I'm wondering... Uh, sorry. Force of habit.",
                "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion": "Holy smokes! My mind can think faster, my body has more energy... There's not a news story out there that can escape me now! But first things first — let's take a photo to commemorate this beautiful moment."

            "Dialogue": "- Charlotte: Hey, there you are! This sure is a mysterious place...\n- Charlotte: I've taken a ton of photos — and boy, do I have a list of questions for you!\n- Traveler: How do you like it here?\n\t- Charlotte: It's idyllic. And the lighting is perfect — you can take the most beautiful photos from literally any angle.\n\t- Charlotte: And yet... We're currently inside your teapot... right?\n\t- Traveler: That's right. Does that worry you?\n\t\t- Charlotte: No, not really. I was just wondering... What happens if someone opens the lid and pours water in?\n\t\t- Charlotte: How would that manifest in here? A flood? A storm? Would the water level start rising from beneath our feet?\n\t\t- Charlotte: I'd love to record that as it happens... Would you mind heading outside for a second and pouring some water in?\n\t- Traveler: I don't use this pot to brew tea. So don't worry.\n\t\t- Charlotte: Really? You've never brewed tea in here? Ah, well that's a shame. I was going to ask you about how this unique environment affects the flavor of the tea.\n\t\t- Charlotte: I heard this legend during an interview with someone from Liyue once. They said there was once an adeptus who poured half of the Bishui River into their teapot to brew some tea...\n\t\t- Charlotte: When the tea was ready, the adeptus poured the whole pot back into the river, and that's how the river got its distinct color.\n\t\t- Charlotte: No idea if there's any truth to it... I'd sure like to taste the water from the Bishui River if I ever got the chance, just to see if there's any hint of a tea flavor.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)\n- Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?\n\t- Charlotte: Sure — anything you wanna know about in particular? Ooh, I know... I'll tell you about the time that \"Bedazzled!\" caused a huge scandal.\n\t- Charlotte: They once ran a special report which claimed that the production and promotion of Fonta was part of a sinister plot by the Fontaine Research Institute.\n\t- Traveler: Sounds like a tasty conspiracy theory.\n\t- Charlotte: Right? Anyway, they put forward a theory that long-term consumption of Fonta makes human teeth and bones incredibly fragile.\n\t- Charlotte: It would end up destroying people's bodies to the point where they could no longer take care of themselves — even walking and eating would be agonizingly difficult.\n\t- Charlotte: Finally, people would be forced into relying on machines just to survive. And that's when the Fontaine Research Institute, who develops all kinds of meka, would swoop in to save the day and turn a huge profit in the process.\n\t- Traveler: That's extremely far-fetched...\n\t- Charlotte: Most of my colleagues and I thought so, too. As far as we're concerned, \"Bedazzled!\" makes up things like this all the time, so we thought nothing of it.\n\t- Charlotte: But it turned out that a whole bunch of people who already hated Fonta were completely convinced it was true... Well, either that, or they saw it as a good opportunity to vent their grievances.\n\t- Charlotte: Either way, after that article was published, the Maison Gestion was inundated with complaint letters accusing Fonta of harming children.\n\t- Charlotte: They claimed that Fonta doesn't just damage childrens' teeth, but also stunts their growth, discourages them from drinking plain water, and ruins their appetites...\n\t- Charlotte: It all got so out of hand that Mr. Heinry got pressured into doing a public interview with The Steambird, in which he stated that he would personally prove that Fonta was harmless...\n\t- Traveler: How did he plan to do that?\n\t- Charlotte: He declared that he would start drinking three cups of Fonta every day until he turned 60.\n\t- Charlotte: He also promised to publish the results of his monthly physical check-ups in The Steambird to make them available for public scrutiny.\n\t- Traveler: I shouldn't laugh, but... This is a hilarious story.\n\t- Charlotte: Hahaha, it really is. We've been joking about it in the office ever since. He's never gonna live this one down.\n\t- Charlotte: To his credit though, Mr. Heinry managed to turn the whole fiasco into a huge publicity stunt for Fonta. Their sales really rocketed for a while off the back of this.\n\t- Charlotte: And for all his big promises about publishing his monthly medical reports and drinking Fonta till he turned 60... Well, a few months later, everyone had moved on and forgotten all about it.\n(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)\n- Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?\n\t- Charlotte: Well... I'd like to take some photos for work, if it's alright with you?\n\t- Charlotte: I'd love to do a story about that big plump talking finch, for example. Now that would be an interesting read!\n\t- Traveler: You'd have to ask Tubby for her permission on that...\n\t- Charlotte: Ahh, so Tubby's its name... Don't worry, I'm a professional! I always make sure to get people's consent before publishing anything that's specifically about them.\n\t- Charlotte: Speaking of consent, would you have any objections to the general public learning about this wondrous teapot of yours?\n\t- Traveler: Please keep my poor teapot out of the talons of The Steambird, Charlotte...\n\t- Charlotte: Sure thing. If you're not comfortable with me reporting on it, I'll keep it out of the news.\n\t- Charlotte: But... Could you at least tell me... who made this teapot for you?\n\t- Traveler: It was an adeptus from Liyue.\n\t- Charlotte: An adeptus? Wow! Uh... Maybe you could introduce me? I'm so fascinated by the adepti — I'd love to learn more about them.\n\t- Charlotte: I hear there's all sorts of rules and taboos you have to observe when you're seeking an adeptus... Are you able to go over all of that with me?\n\t- Traveler: It's not that complicated. I can just take you there.\n\t- Charlotte: Really!? Amazing. Well that settles it — I'll put it in my schedule and come find you when I'm ready. No backing out, okay?\n\t- Charlotte: ...I knew you were well-connected, but wow, fraternizing with the adepti? That's really incredible.\n\t- Charlotte: Now that I've got a friend like you, I'll never need to worry about networking again! Hahaha...\n\t- Charlotte: An exclusive interview with an adeptus... What would a good title be? ...\"Investigating an Adeptus\"?\n\t- Charlotte: No, no, no, it needs to sound more reverent — they'd probably have me thrown down the mountain for suggesting that...\n\t- Charlotte: Journey to Jueyun... Ooh, that's it! I think I'll go with: \"Journey to Jueyun: Liyue's Pilgrim Trail.\"\n(Between 6:00 and 19:00)\n- Traveler: Good morning, Charlotte.\n\t- Charlotte: Morning! Oh, snap, look at the time — I'd better go grab today's paper.\n\t- Charlotte: I'll bring a copy back for you as well.\n(Between 19:00 and 6:00)\n- Traveler: Good night, Charlotte.\n\t- Charlotte: Good night! Ahh... At this hour, I'd usually be proofreading a manuscript or drafting my next one...\n\t- Charlotte: I'm not used to having so much free time. Hahaha...\n\t- Charlotte: *gasp* Wait... Did I submit my latest article? I think I did...? Yeah, pretty sure I did...\n",
